Aus texttypologischer Sicht handelt es sich aber eher um einen PR-Text, der so aussieht, als sei er ein Auszug aus einer Wahlkampfbrosch\u00fcre. Der Vortrag analysiert den Text zun\u00e4chst inhaltlich, um zu zeigen, worum es im Einzelnen geht und wo Widerspr\u00fcche auftauchen, dann aus textkritischer und aus linguistischer Perspektive. Insbesondere werden bestimmte Interessen der Bundesregierung und anderer Akteure deutlich, die weniger offen thematisiert werden, aber doch sprachlich zu Tage treten.",

Das \u201enetzpolitische Regierungsprogramm\u201c wurde begr\u00fc\u00dft, aber viele Kritiker qualifizierten es als \u201ezu wenig, zu sp\u00e4t\u201c. Dabei ist wenigen aufgefallen, dass es sich in Bezug auf die Textsorte um einen PR-Text handelt, der wenig \u00c4hnlichkeiten mit einem Regierungsprogramm hat, sondern eher so aussieht, als stamme er aus einer Wahlkampfbrosch\u00fcre. Eine textkritische und eine linguistische Analyse ergeben, dass von einer \u201eAgenda\u201c wenig zu sp\u00fcren ist, obwohl das Wort \u201eaktiv\u201c sehr h\u00e4ufig verwendet wird, allerdings in Kontexten, die nichts mit Aktivit\u00e4ten zu tun haben. Das ist nicht der einzige Widerspruch. Es zeigt sich wieder einmal, dass die Sprache des Textes auch versteckte Interessen an den Tag bringt. ",

Each service, called unikernel,  is an OCaml application using libraries such as a TCP/IP stack, DNS. It is either compiled to a Xen virtual machine image or to a Unix binary (for development). State in 2014 is that it runs on x86 and arm, we implemented a clean-slate TLS (1.0, 1.1, 1.2), X.509, ASN.1 stack, crypto primitives, Off-the-record. We also have TCP/IP, HTTP, a persistent branchable store (similar to git) - all implemented in OCaml. A virtual machine serving data via https is roughly 2MB in size - no libc inside :)", 
                                "description": "Mirage OS is a (BSD-licensed) research project at University of Cambridge and released in December 2013 a 1.0 version. In 2014, 2.0 got released with full support on arm, a clean-slate TLS implementation, and the branchable data store Irmin. We (Hannes and David) developed a TLS stack from scratch (including cryptographic primitives, X.509, ASN.1), which we will present.\r\n\r\nWe intentionally breaks with the UNIX philosophy. Instead of using a programming language designed to replace platform-specific assembly code we use the functional programming language OCaml with higher-order functions, a composable module system, pattern matching, a sophisticated type system. Our developed TLS stack separates side effects, such as mutable memory, network input and output, etc., clearly from the pure functional core. This separation is not enforced on a language level, but by convention.\r\n\r\nA mirage unikernel runs either as a Xen guest or as native Unix application. Each unikernel runs in a single address space, and does not include layers over layers of abstraction (kernel, user space, file system, processes, language runtime, threads, ...). The performance is not too bad (see link below). Each unikernel only uses those libraries it really needs - e.g. a name server does not depend on a file system or user accounts. A common unikernel is rather small in binary size: a web server, including TCP/IP stack and the data to be served, is less than a megabyte in size, including the OCaml runtime. There is no libc included :)\r\n\r\nModularity is the key for Mirage OS: the same application code can be compiled as a UNIX executable using the POSIX socket API, or as UNIX program using the userspace tun/tap interface and the TCP/IP stack written in OCaml, or as a Xen domU. This eases development, testing, debugging, and deployment.\r\n\r\nOur target platform is the cubieboard2, a small board with a dual-core ARM A7 CPU and ethernet (and various other unused interfaces).\r\n\r\nCode reviews, comments, contributions are always welcome.",

                                "description": "16 years ago, Daniel Bleichenbacher presented a protocol-level padding oracle attack against SSL/TLS. As a countermeasure, all TLS RFCs starting from RFC 2246 (TLS 1.0) propose \"to treat incorrectly formatted messages in a manner indistinguishable from correctly formatted RSA blocks\".\r\n\r\nIn our recent paper [1] we show that this objective has not been achieved yet: We present four new Bleichenbacher side channels, and three successful Bleichenbacher attacks against the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) SSL/TLS implementation and against hardware security appliances using the Cavium NITROX SSL accelerator chip. Three of these side channels are timing-based, and two of them provide the first timing-based Bleichenbacher attacks on SSL/TLS described in the literature. Our measurements confirmed that all these side channels are observable over a switched network, with timing differences between 1 and 23 microseconds. We were able to successfully recover the PreMasterSecret using three of the four side channels in a realistic measurement setup.\r\n\r\nBesides the academic relevance of breaking common SSL/TLS implementations, the timing attacks we performed are quite interesting for the hacking community. In our talk, we will thus focus on the challenges we had to solve during our attacks and on the challenges of fixing these issues.\r\n\r\nThe talk extends the topics that I presented at 28c3 [1] and 29c3 [2].\r\n\r\n[1]: Revisiting SSL/TLS Implementations: New Bleichenbacher Side Channels and Attacks.\r\nMeyer, Somorovsky, Weiss, Schwenk, Schinzel, Tews.\r\nUsenix Security Symposium 2014.\r\n[2]: https://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2011/28c3-4640-en-time_is_on_my_side.html\r\n[3]: https://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2012/29c3-5044-en-time_is_not_on_your_side_h264.html",

Every now and then, you hear it thrown around as a possible attack vector - perhaps to aid in reverse-engineering efforts, or to understand an unknown cryptographic implementation. But what is glitching, exactly? And, more importantly, how can it be leveraged as a potentially powerful tool?\r\n\r\nThis presentation chronicles a quest to learn what types of electrical transients can be introduced into an integrated circuit to cause a variety of circuit faults advantageous to an reverser. Several hardware platforms were constructed during the quest to aid in research, including old-skool & solderless breadboards, photo-etched & professional PCBs, FPGAs, and cheap & dirty homemade logic analyzers. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches will be discussed.\r\n\r\nInstead of covering a hypothetical \"toy\" implementation of a victim chip - such as where the researcher/reverser implements a cryptographic algorithm themselves as software in a common microcontroller, and then attempts to glitch the implementation - a successful blackbox attack against a production security IC will be discussed, including how the attack was mounted, how results were obtained, and approaches to interpret the results.\r\n\r\nDespite claims of its obsolescence, electrical glitching can be a viable attack vector against a variety of ICs, with a notable exception being some ultra-modern purpose-built security ICs. It is cheap to perform, you don't need an expensive laboratory, and if done properly, is non-destructive in nature. Glitching should be another tool in the reverser's arsenal, and can potentially provide results when other approaches have failed.",

Verursacher war die \"Agentur zur Analyse des Internets\" aus St. Petersburg, die mutma\u00dflich von staatlichen Akteuren damit beauftragt wurde, die \u00f6ffentliche Meinung in anderen L\u00e4ndern durch verdeckte Operationen in sozialen Netzwerken zu beeinflussen. Und in S\u00fcdkorea hat die Abteilung Psychologische Strategie des National Intelligence Service (NIS) mittels gef\u00e4lschter Twitter-Accounts im Vorfeld der Pr\u00e4sendentschaftswahlen 1,2 Millionen Tweets versendet, um Stimmung f\u00fcr Park Geun Hye, Kandidatin der konservativen Saenuri-Partei zu machen. \r\n\r\nDer digitale Informationskrieg ist also l\u00e4ngst im Gang. Er zielt wie traditionelle Psychologische Operationen auf die Beeinflussung von Wissen, Werten, Gef\u00fchlen und Handlungsdispositionen und will Agenda Setting in der gegnerischen \u00d6ffentlichkeit betreiben. Von den traditionellen PSYOPS unterscheidet ihn, dass er maschinell und klandestin gef\u00fchrt wird und statt massenkommunikativ zu agieren \u00fcber die M\u00f6glichkeit verf\u00fcgt, jeden, der sich in sozialen Netzwerken bewegt, pers\u00f6nlich und mit einer individuellen Strategie anzusprechen. Der Bot ist ein Kombattant mit der Aufgabe, Menschen zu beeinflussen, konstruktive Diskussionen zu verhindern und Social-Media-Monitoring-Systeme und Aggregatoren zu manipulieren. Sein Medium ist in erster Linie die Sprache, die einordnen, bewerten, konfrontieren und \u00fcberzeugen will, die eine Wirklichkeit erschaffen will, in der das Handeln der eigenen Konfliktpartei als legitim, gerecht und zwingend und das des Feindes als falsch, unrecht und unwahrhaftig erscheint. \r\n\r\nIn unserem Vortrag werden wir den Begriff der operativen Kommunikation aus sprachwissenschaftlicher Perspektive definieren, ihre rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen im Informationskrieg bestimmen und die Legitimit\u00e4t von operativer Kommunikation f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Regimetypen diskutieren. Anhand eines selbst entwickelten einfachen Bots wollen wir im zweiten Teil des Vortrags Szenarien f\u00fcr den operativen Einsatz in der semantischen Matrix vorstellen und die linguistischen Operationen illustrieren, die zur Manipulation von Kommunikation f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen.

This invites memory safety bugs that attackers can exploit to divert control flow and compromise the system. Deployed defence mechanisms (e. g., ASLR, DEP) are incomplete, and stronger defence mechanisms (e. g., CFI) often have high overhead and limited guarantees (and are therefore not generally deployed).\r\n\r\nIn this talk we discuss code-pointer integrity (CPI), a strong security policy that guarantees the integrity of all code pointers in a program (e.g., function pointers, saved return addresses) and thereby prevents all control-flow hijack attacks, including return-oriented programming and jump-oriented programming. We also introduce code-pointer separation (CPS), a relaxation of CPI with better performance properties. Both CPI and CPS offer substantially better\r\nsecurity-to-overhead ratios than the state of the art, they are practical (we protect a complete FreeBSD system and over 100 packages like apache and postgresql), effective (prevent all attacks in the RIPE benchmark), and efficient, resulting in very low to negligible performance overhead.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss technical challenges in the CPI prototype implementation, practical challenges we faced when protecting a full FreeBSD distribution, and give more details on the scope of protection which will be interesting to hackers.  The full prototype implementation is open-source, all changes to FreeBSD are open-source and we're working on integrating the patches into LLVM.",

There is a widespread misconception that somehow the new GDPR privacy regulation will curb foreign spying, when in fact it is designed to widen loopholes into floodgates.\r\nThis talk is multidisciplinary and will cover national and international surveillance and privacy law, Five Eyes SIGINT policy, technical security and economics.",

Some years later Hertz brought the experimental prove of Maxwell's theory.\r\n\r\nUnder a lot of simplifying boundary conditions wave propagation and antenna theory can be derived from this four equations. This talk will lead from Maxwell's equations to wave equations and nice antenna forms and arrays. Also some practical aspects will be evaluated. Why do low frequencies reach farther than higher frequencies? Why do radio astronomers spread their antenna arrays over whole continents?

At the talk we will present the first successes of this endeavor in our community - Open Source pattern making software, sewing robots, next generation knitting machine upgrades - and challenges that are ahead.\r\n\r\nDemocratizing digital textile production and offers the chance for a fair and environment friendly production of garments and textiles at home and in the industry. Just as 3D printers enable more and more people to become makers we want to enable digital garment makers to create their own clothes, share them online and produce it where-ever they are.\r\n\r\nMembers of our projects include software developers, fashion designers, pattern creators, knitters, textile manipulators, hardware hackers, and even industry experts. We started a FashionTec Working Group about two years ago after the annual Libre Graphics meeting in Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe traditional industry is in a state of complete lock on all levels:\r\n* digital fashion design locked to competing proprietary formats and software\r\n* production locked to machines of producers accepting formats\r\n* distribution lock - locked to existing large distribution channels in order to be a viable business\r\n\r\nThe Free and Open Source community has taught us that it is possible to overcome a complete proprietary lock down. Let\u2019s repeat this success in the textile and garment industry. We need Free and Open Source software, Open Formats and Open machines. With todays development tools successes are just a short step away. Our talk will give you insights and hopes to inspire more people.\r\n",

                                "description": "All large, feature-rich and complex frameworks suck. True, but too short for a talk. Therefore the talk tries to make a point on why one should still us these frameworks (for robotics). At least so, if one wants to have fun with (home/hackerspace) robotics and do something cool, instead of getting stuck at the usual \"trivial\" (or low-level, sounds less judging) capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn order to build robots one needs at least a basic understanding of mechanics, electronics and computer science. Obviously, more advanced robot features in each area, depend on more advanced roboticist skills \u2013 and equipment ... and money. The growing community of makers, the proliferation of hackerspaces (cooperators, equipment!) and highly useful consumer devices lessen the hardware related challenges. On the other hand, state-of-the-art open-source robotics software has been available for quite a few years already. Unfortunately, it is still somewhat neglected by the extended, i. e. non-academic, robotics community. The mindset and prejudices of too many hackerspace natives is opposed to using preexisting frameworks, especially large ones, in favor of starting from scratch. Bloat, ugly APIs, deprecated programming styles and of course bad code conventions ... good and good enough reasons to start over (I confess, too!). As a result many projects never get beyond the point of \"finally fixed the bug by reflashing the microcontroller with code that sets register bar42=0xf00, now it moves \u2013 sort of\".\r\n\r\nThe famous \"Re-inventing the Wheel\" comic (http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/blog/201004/willow_p1_02s.jpg) posted by Willow Garage in 2010, does tell the life cycle of robotics in the PhD world, but not only that. Rather, unfortunately, it pertains to robotic and closely related projects in general.\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell, yet another 'Introduction to ROS' talk? Yes, an introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS).\r\nHowever, for once without leaving behind the impression (in the hobbyists mind) that this is all cool stuff, but what to do with it when not owning a 100K dollar robot.\r\nThe goal is to show a few basics (the Plumbing), as many of the tools and capabilities as time permits and a few words about the people side of things.\r\n(http://www.ros.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ros_equation.png)\r\nShould the robot visually perceive the world? ROS + Webcam(s) / Kinect / Xtion. Hello, out of the box drivers, calibration, point clouds and object recognition.\r\nShould the robot drive around and navigate in the environment? ROS + Navigation stack. Hello, out of the box SLAM.\r\nShould the robot reach out and grasp something? ROS + MoveIt!. Hello, out of the box collision-free motion planning.\r\nShould the robot brain be distributed across multiple computers without changing a line of code? ROS. Hello, out of the box usable(!) middleware.\r\nShould the robot builders be able to create independent, yet compatible modules? ROS.

Compared to Mr. Data or C-3PO, humanoids in reality are rather disappointing. Not only do they lack anything resembling human-level intelligence, but even their walking is slow and fragile - most of them only work on perfectly even ground. While we still have to wait a long time for true artificial intelligence, the recent years have brought substantial progress with respect to motion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of that progress is proprietary - the leading groups, such as Schaft and Boston Dynamics, publish very little beyond Youtube videos. University projects are more open, but still usually do not publish source code or construction drawings. We think that bipedal robots are way too important to be left to the proprietary world, so we decided to learn from what is available and start to build our own, completely open one. In the talk, we will try to share what we have learned so far.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the talk will be on simulation, which allows us to test control algorithms and to get an idea about the mechanical requirements without having to build actual hardware. We will introduce the basics of rigid body dynamics, discuss the physics of walking and show how a successful walking machine can be built, at least a virtual one.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the talk, we will discuss how a physical, human-size robot might be built without needing a 100,000+ \u20ac budget. We will present our plans and experiments on sensors, motor drivers and actuators.",

Dabei ist ein grundlegendes Verst\u00e4ndnis von Computertechnologien Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr, sich in einer Welt der digitalen Technologien zurechtzufinden und sie mitgestalten zu k\u00f6nnen. Da sind sich alle einig, und es wird viel dar\u00fcber gesprochen. Doch die gro\u00dfe Bildungsinitiative l\u00e4sst auf sich warten, und Nachwuchstalente werden gesellschaftlich noch immer wenig beachtet und noch seltener aktiv gef\u00f6rdert. \r\n\r\nWir von der gemeinn\u00fctzigen Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland e.V. wollten nicht l\u00e4nger warten und haben deswegen 2013 das F\u00f6rderprogramm Jugend hackt ins Leben gerufen. Zuletzt kamen im September 2014 rund 120 Jugendliche aus ganz Deutschland in Berlin zusammen. Gemeinsam mit Gleichgesinnten haben sie an Software- und Hardwareprojekten rund um die Themen \u00dcberwachung, Bildung, Gesundheit, Gesellschaft, Freizeit und Umwelt gearbeitet. \r\n\r\nDie Jugendlichen, die zwischen 12 und 18 Jahre alt sind, entwickelten insgesamt 27 Projekte, mit denen sie ein deutliches Statement gegen das beliebte Narrativ der politisch desinteressierten Jugend setzten. Sie zeigten nicht nur, dass sie technisch versiert und kreativ mit Computern umgehen konnten, sondern auch einen wachsamen und kritischen Blick auf gesellschaftliche und politische Herausforderungen haben. Alle 27 Projektideen sind selbstst\u00e4ndig von den Jugendlichen erarbeitet und umgesetzt worden. F\u00fcr Fragen standen den Jugendlichen erwachsene Softwareentwickler/innen zur Seite.\r\n\r\nAuf dem 31c3 wollen wir unsere Erfahrungen mit euch teilen. Zudem werden Teilnehmer von Jugend hackt ihre entstandenen Projekte vorstellen. Da ist z.B. \"Awearness\", ein Armband, das vibriert, wenn eine \u00dcberwachungskamera in der N\u00e4he ist. Oder \"Dapro\", ein Datenschutzproxy, der \u00fcber aufgezeichnete Metadaten informiert. Oder die \"intelligente Pillenbox\", die Tabletten an demenzkranke Patienten ausgibt und bei Nicht-Einnahme einen Notruf an den Pfleger absetzt.",

Banking apps \u2013 on smartphones and tablets - are  widespreading more and more and this evolution aims at strongly limiting the classical access to bank (physical, through PC browser, through ATM\u2026). The aim is first to cut the cost but also to make the personal data explode. \r\nThen three critical issues arise. Since we entrust those mobile applications by feeding them with passwords, private information, and access to one of the most critical part of our like (money):\r\n\u2022\tDo those applications protect our private life and especially which kind of information is leaking to the bank?\r\n\u2022\tAre they containing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers?\r\nIn this talk, we are going to present a deep analysis of many banking apps collected in the world. We have performed static and dynamic analysis based on the binaries AND the source code. We will show that almost all apps are endangering our private data (sometimes severely) but in a few cases the presence of vulnerabilities are extremely concerning. While we tried to contact all the relevant banks for a free, detailed technical feedback and to help them fixing their apps, we will explain that a few of them did not care about this feedback and therefore did not want to take any security measure.\r\nThis talk contains demos and operational results on existing apps.\r\n",

The main question of our study is to determine how this insecurity is mitigated by network operator\u2019s action to prevent compromise on both network exposure of infrastructure and privacy compromise of subscribers.\r\nThe goal of SS7map is to provide a global overview by building the first SS7 signaling network world map revealing how vulnerable and exposed are telecom operators and their subscribers. We explain how it is possible for each mapped network to abuse legitimate signalling messages and call flows to discover and fingerprint equipment, intercept SMS messages, and perform massive location tracking of subscribers. More than pure analysis of vulnerability, this map rates and ranks the vulnerability of countries and operators showing discrepancies in the level and type of protection: SCCP screening, SS7 policing, MAP filtering, rate limiting, Network Element security configurations. We then conclude on the direction of signaling security and its current trend and development in the LTE world that shares many similar design insecurities with SS7.",

These are switches used in industrial environments, like substations, factories, refineries, ports, or other other homes of industrial automation. In other words: DCS, PCS, ICS & SCADA switches. \r\n\r\nThe researchers focus on attacking the management plane of these switches, because we all know that industrial system protocols lack authentication or cryptographic integrity. Thus, compromising any switch allows the creation of malicious firmwares for further MITM manipulation of a live process.\r\n\r\nNot only will vulnerabilities be disclosed for the first time (exclusively at 31C3), but the methods of finding those vulnerabilities will be shared. All vulnerabilities disclosed will be in the default configuration state of the devices. While these vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the vendors, SCADA/ICS patching in live environments tends to take 1-3 years. At least three vendors switches will be examined: Siemens, GE, Garrettcom. \r\n\r\nTherefore, this presentation matters to any hackers or anarchists, who believe they have a right to examine the resilience and security of the  infrastructures that support their communities.\r\n\r\nOwn your own critical infrastructures today!\r\n",

This makes the security of Estonia's Internet voting system of interest to technologists and citizens the world over. Over the past year, I helped lead the first rigorous, independent security evaluation of the system, based on election observation, code review, and laboratory testing. The findings are alarming: there are staggering gaps in Estonia's procedural and operational security, and the architecture of the system leaves it open to cyberattacks from foreign powers. Our investigation confirmed the viability of these attacks in the lab, but the Estonian government has chosen to downplay them. We urgently recommend that Estonia discontinue use of the system before the country suffers a major attack.", 
                                "description": "When Estonia introduced its online voting system in 2005, it became the first country to offer Internet voting nationally. Today, people around the world look to Estonia's example, and some wonder why they can't vote online too. Nevertheless, the system remains controversial.  While many Estonians view Internet voting as a source of national pride, one major political party has repeatedly called for it to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, I took part in the first rigorous and fully independent security analysis of the Estonian Internet voting system. My team observed operations during the October 2013 and May 2014 elections, conducted interviews with the system developers and election officials, assessed the software through source code review and reverse engineering, and performed tests on a reproduction of the complete system in our lab.\r\n\r\nThe threats facing national elections have shifted significantly since the Estonian system was designed more than a decade ago. State-level cyberattacks, once a largely hypothetical threat, has become a well documented reality, and attacks by foreign states are now a credible threat to a national online voting system. To test the feasibility of such attacks, we reproduced the I-voting system and played the role of a sophisticated attacker during a mock election. We developed client-side attacks that silently steal votes on voters' own computers  We also demonstrated server-side attacks that target introduce malware into the vote counting server, allowing a foreign power or dishonest insider to shifting results in favor of their preferred candidate.\r\n\r\nThese risks are even more serious because of deviations from procedure and serious lapses in operational security that we observed during real elections.  Election workers downloaded security-critical software over unsecured Internet connections, typed server root passwords in full view of observers and public video cameras, and prepared election software for distribution to the public on insecure personal computers, among other examples. These actions indicate a dangerously inadequate level of professionalism in security administration that leaves the whole system open to attack and manipulation.\r\n\r\nWhen we made our study public in Estonia, government responses ranged from dismissive to absurd. Officials discounted them, and the President and Prime Minister insinuated that we had been bought off by a rival political party. We hope that the country can separate technical reality from politics in time to avert a major attack. For other countries that are considering adopting Internet voting, we hope that the weaknesses of the Estonian system can be an important cautionary lesson.",

It was built by Motorola over 15 years ago, and parts of it remain unchanged to this day.\r\n\r\nIridium pagers are similar to other pager systems from that time (they are receive-only devices) with the benefit that they will work anywhere on earth. Additionally they work on a receiver-pays subscription model, and due to their age are probably not using cryptography.\r\n\r\nBroadcasting messages all over the world sounds interesting enough to take a closer look. As Iridium is a proprietary system, documentation is scarce and hard to come by. But with the rise of software defined radio we can take a peek at what happens over the air...\r\n",

This talk will investigate how a government\u2019s ability to censor and limit the flow of information feeds into its choice of violent responses to protest. I will talk about the conditions under which a government is likely to benefit more from surveilling the free flow of information, and under which conditions it is more likely to benefit from censorship. \r\n", 
                                "description": "A few weeks before the first mass protests ensued across Syria in March 2011, the Regime led by President Bashar Al-Assad lifted a large number of bans on social networking platforms, including Facebook and Youtube. Up to that point, the Regime had controlled the most regulated media landscape and telecommunications market in the Middle East, which is why the move towards providing access to social media sites not even permitted in China was not something to be expected. Why, after all these years of extreme censorship, does a government suddenly permit free access to, and generation of, information? \r\nThe ability to connect via large social network platforms has been celebrated as an important way for ordinary citizens to collectively organise protest in light of repressive rulers. The revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa have spurred a new and important research area on the effects of digital communication technology on citizen\u2019s propensity to voice dissent and organise protest and resistance. The fact that anyone with a working network connection can now access, generate, and exchange content on the internet has been termed a \u2018game changer\u2019 for authoritarian regimes intent on maintaining control in light of mass popular protest. \r\nWhat has remained largely unanswered, is how regimes resolved to stay in power can make use of their ability to surveil, censor, and limit the flow of information in an age where the majority of communication has been relegated to the inter- net and mobile phones. Understanding the way in which this new form of control feeds into more traditional means of repression, such as the use of extreme forms of physical coercion, is a crucial part of this process. In this talk, I will discuss under which conditions the free flow of information is likely to prove helpful in conducting effective state repression, and under which conditions the censoring of information access is likely to be more beneficial. \r\nRegimes intent on maintaining power against all adversaries have long since combined the use of censorship with physical violations of those deemed threatening to their position. The introduction of digital communication technology has, however, altered the costs and benefits of limiting the flow of information when conducting coercive campaigns. When Syria\u2019s government decided to unblock social networking sites, it might thus have simultaneously increased its intelligence for counterinsurgency operations, while also providing new ways of collective action for the opposition. Investigating these changes and how they affect the tactics of state violence is a crucial first step in understanding how contemporary and future governments are likely to incorporate their control of communication technology into strategies of repression.\r\nI use supervised machine-learning to analyze over 60,000 records of killings perpetrated by the Syrian Regime in the ongoing conflict, and classify them according to their event circumstances, to arrive at a categorization between targeted and untargeted acts of repression. I find that higher levels of information accessibility are consistently linked to an increase in the proportion of targeted repression, whereas areas with little or no access witness more indiscriminate campaigns of violence. \r\n",

In den Hardwareanforderungen f\u00fcr Windows 8 wird Secure Boot verpflichtend vorausgesetzt. Andere Betriebssysteme k\u00f6nnen in der Praxis bisher nur mit technisch und rechtlich problematischen Notkonstruktionen gestartet werden.\r\n\r\nF\u00fcr die stark wachsende ARM Prozessorwelt soll dem Nutzer sogar komplett die Kontrolle entzogen werden. Dies beinhaltet sogar eine Zwangsaktivierung und ein Verbot der Deaktivierung des Microsoft kontrollierten Secure Bootprozesses.\r\n\r\nWas vielen lange Zeit als der bekannte Kampf zwischen Hackern und Microsoft um die freie Nutzung unsere Ger\u00e4tschaften erschien, erhielt durch die politischen Entwicklungen h\u00f6chste Brisanz f\u00fcr die gesamte Industrie. Micosoft kann und hat auch schon ohne nachvollziehbare Begr\u00fcndung konkurierende Bootloader deaktiviert.\r\n\r\nEin Szenario, dass Microsoft (m\u00f6glicher Weise durch US Regierungsdruck) die Berechtigung f\u00fcr die von Microsoft unterschriebene Bootloader f\u00fcr Linux-Distributionen zur\u00fcckzieht, will man sich insbesondere f\u00fcr sicherheitskritische Systeme oder eingebettete Systeme nicht wirklich vorstellen.\r\n\r\nW\u00e4hrend deutsche Beh\u00f6rden dar\u00fcber diskutieren wie sehr vor Windows 8 gewarnt werden sollte, verbot China v\u00f6llig die Verwendung von Windows 8 auf staatlichen Computern.\r\n\r\nIm Vortrag sollen weitere technische und gesellschaftliche Konsequenzen vom Microsoft kontrollierten Sicherheitsinfrastrukturen und m\u00f6gliche Gegenmassnahmen diskutiert werden.\r\n",

                                "abstract": "We introduce Fernvale, a reverse-engineered, open hardware and software platform based upon Mediatek's MT6260 value phone SoC. The MT6260 is the chip that powers many of the $10 GSM feature phones produced by the Shanzhai. \r\n\r\nFernvale is made available as open-licensed schematics, board layouts, and an RTOS based upon the BSD-licensed NuttX, as well as a suite of open tools for code development and firmware upload. We discuss our technical reverse engineering efforts, as well as our methodology to lawfully import IP from the Shanzhai ecosystem into the Maker ecosystem. We hope to establish a repeatable, if not labor-intensive, model for opening up previously closed IP of interest, thereby outlining a path to leveling the playing field for lawful Makers.\r\n", 
                                "description": "There is a set of technology which Makers are legally allowed access, and there is a much larger set of technology which is used to make our every day gadgets. Access to the best closed-source technology is prevented via barriers such as copyright (limiting your ability to learn how it works), patent (limiting your ability to make something similar), and supply-chain (limiting your ability to buy it). As a result, open-licensed, Maker-friendly technologies have trailed closed-source technology in terms of cost, performance, and features. \r\n\r\nMakers operating under Western IP law are legally bound by these barriers, and are forced to settle for Arduinos, Beaglebones, Raspberry Pis and Novenae. However, all of these are a far cry in terms of cost, performance, and features from what consumers typically expect from boxes purchased in retail stores. \r\n\r\nOur research into the Chinese ecosystem indicates there is another way. Originally marginalized as outlaws and copycats, the Shanzhai of China \u2013 China's counterpart to the Western hacker-maker \u2013 exist in a realm where copyright and patent barriers are permeable, a state which we refer to as 'gongkai'. As a result, knowledge and access to state of the art closed source technology has diffused into the Shanzhai ecosystem. Today, they have moved beyond the rote copying of Nokia, Samsung, and Apple, and have created a thriving, vibrant ecosystem where mobile technology is rip/mix/burned; their products are mass-produced at a rate of millions per month for the \u201crest of the world\u201d, e.g. emerging markets such as Africa, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Russia. \r\n\r\nAbout a year ago, we did a tear-down of an example $12 phone, and contrasted it to the Arduino Uno. For $29, the Arduino Uno gets you a 16MHz, 8-bit CPU with 2.5k of RAM, and USB plus a smattering of GPIO as the sole interfaces. For $12, a phone out of the Chinese gongkai ecosystem gets you a 260 MHz, 32-bit CPU with 8MiB of RAM, with USB, microSD, SIM, quad-band GSM, Bluetooth, an OLED display and a battery. It begs the question of why, when Makers talk about IoT technologies in the West, they typically think of wifi-powered solutions in the $20-70 range, versus a GSM platform in the $10-$20 range. \r\n\r\nIn this lecture, we disclose an attempt to short-circuit the disclosure barrier. We are releasing an open hardware and software solution built around the Mediatek MT6260. The MT6260 is a 32-bit ARM7EJ-S SoC with 8MiB of PSRAM in-package, as well as USB, LCD, touchscreen, audio, Bluetooth, quad-band GSM, dual-SIM, FM radio, UART, keypad, SD card, camera, and other peripherals integrated. The chip can be purchased on the over-the-counter market for about $2-3 in China. We call our solution built around this chip \u201cFernvale\u201d. \r\n\r\nFernvale is similar to the \u201cLinkIt ONE\u201d recently released by Mediatek and Seeed Studios, based upon the MT2502A SoC and targeted at IoT and wearables. LinkIt indicates a new direction for Mediatek and we are optimistic that their effort indicates a new pattern of openness toward Makers. At the time of this proposal's submission, the details of the LinkIt ONE platform are still unfolding, but the basic feature set looks comparable to that of Fernvale. However, it seems the LinkIt SDK is still based upon a closed-source Nucleus RTOS providing services to an open Arduino-like API.\r\n\r\nUnlike LinkIt ONE, Fernvale runs a port of NuttX, a small-footprint BSD-licensed RTOS that is Posix and ANSI compliant, and includes a partial set of drivers for the available hardware peripherals. The mainboard is laid out to function as either a SoM (system on module) or as a truncated Arduino shield (with the appropriate headers populated), and focuses on the computational abilities of the platform. In other words, Fernvale is not positioned as a mobile phone solution per se, but rather as an Engineering Development Kit (EDK) for embedded applications that can benefit from a highly-integrated, low-cost high-performance microcontroller solution such as the MT6260. As a result, the mainboard breaks out a selection of GPIO as well as the speaker, battery, USB, and SD card interfaces. The mainboard also serves as a base platform for rallying a larger community of developers who can aid with the task of reverse engineering and writing legally open drivers for its massive peripheral set. \r\n\r\nTwo expansion headers are provided on the mainboard. A larger UX header can be used to attach a keypad + LCD + audio interface, for applications that require UI elements. A smaller analog header enables users to attach an RF front-end of their choosing, which could potentially enable GSM-compatible voice and data services, if drivers were to exist.\r\n\r\nThis lecture will also discuss our experiences reverse engineering, and our approach to open-sourcing the MT6260. We had to reverse engineer significant portions of the system, including but not limited to circuit board layouts, hardware configuration options, bootloader protocols, partial register maps, and the internal boot ROM of the SoC. This reverse engineering effort was necessary to create a blob-free software implementation, and to give developers an alternative to  Mediatek's proprietary firmware flashing utilities to upload code. It was also necessary to create schematics and circuit board maskworks which have an original copyright thereby giving us the right to pick an open license for the hardware designs. \r\n\r\nWe took special pains to ensure our method was lawful and the resulting work is copyright-clean under U.S. law. We did review some non-open-licensed chip documentation and code examples available for download from open file-sharing sites. None of these materials were restricted by DRM. American copyright law contains a fair-use exception that allows limited copying and examination of such materials for the purpose of understanding the ideas and functional concepts embodied in them. We believe our download and review of those materials is fair use. Should potential copyright holders disagree with our interpretation, we invite any offended parties to engage us in rational discourse.\r\n\r\nWe believe that Makers have for too long lived in the shadow of overbearing copyright laws. We need to develop an example of how to import ideas from less strict IP jurisdictions where innovation is flourishing; failing this, hardware Makers run the risk of being eternally behind the Shanzhai. Fernvale is our first attempt at developing a legal context for importing IP from the gongkai ecosystem into a fully open source solution; we hope our example will embolden other developers to pursue more ambitious targets. We also hope our work may, in the long term, catalyze meaningful Maker-friendly reform to Western IP law by raising awareness of the disparity between East and West, with the success of the Shanzhai serving as evidence of how permissive IP policy can be good for both grass-roots innovators (the Shanzhai) and big businesses (Mediatek and the phone network operators) alike.\r\n",

The vulnerability was one of the most consequential in the history of the Internet, since it allowed attackers to potentially steal login credentials, cryptographic keys, and other private data from up to half of all popular HTTPS sites.  In this talk, we take a detailed look at Heartbleed and its aftermath, based on comprehensive measurements and analysis that our research team performed over the past six months.  We began tracking Heartbleed's impact within hours of its disclosure using massive ZMap scans and large network telescopes.  This allowed us to track which sites remained vulnerable, observe certificate revocations, and monitor for large scale attacks in close to real time. Based on this data, we also conducted one of the largest ever mass vulnerability notifications, informing the network administrators for all devices still susceptible to Heartbleed across the entire IPv4 address space.  Finally, we investigated the question of whether attackers knew about and exploited Heartbleed prior to its public disclosure---and we will present new details about this question in the talk.  We hope that by learning from the Heartbleed security disaster, our community can prepare to respond more effectively to such events in the future. ", 
                                "description": "<p>In March 2014, researchers found a catastrophic vulnerability in OpenSSL, the cryptographic library used to secure connections in popular servers including Apache and Nginx. The bug allowed attackers to extract cryptographic keys, login credentials, and other private data from an estimated 22-55% of HTTPS sites. Worsening its severity, the bug was both simple to understand and exploit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used ZMap to perform comprehensive scans of the IPv4 address space and popular web servers in the days and months following disclosure. We provide more extensive estimates on who was originally vulnerable, track who patched their sites, and replaced certificates. We will present exactly which server products and devices were vulnerable. We will further discuss how Heartbleed affected the HTTPS CA ecosystem. Worryingly, we find that only 10% of the known vulnerable sites replaced their certificates within the next month, and of those that did, 14% neglected to change the private key, gaining no protection from certificate replacement! We'll also present the shortcomings in the public key infrastructure that Heartbleed unearthed and problems our community needs to focus on moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We investigated widespread attempts to exploit Heartbleed post disclosure at four network sites. We will discuss the subsequent exploit attempts we observed from almost 700 sources and the Internet-wide scans that started post disclosure. We also investigated whether exploit attempts took place prior to Heartbleed's public disclosure, including examining suspicious network traces recorded months earlier.  We will disclose new details of these traces and their implications in the talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with global publicity, Heartbleed patching plateaued after two weeks. To try to help, we notified network administrators responsible for more than 500,000 unpatched systems. While much of the security community (including us!) assumed that mass vulnerability notifications would be too difficult or ineffective, we found that it increased the Heartbleed patching rate by nearly 50%.  We will discuss how we performed these notifications, the reactions of network operators, and prospects for performing automatic mass notifications based on Internet-wide scanning in future vulnerability events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the talk, we will use real world data to frame what went well and what went poorly in the Internet's response to Heartbleed. The vulnerability's severe risks, widespread impact, and costly global cleanup qualify it as a security disaster. However, by understanding what went wrong and learning from it, the Internet security community can be better prepared to address major security failures in the future.</p>",

This session will discuss the specific steps taken to prevent early disclosure, creating and scaling the first public vulnerability test, how the CloudFlare Heartbleed challenge showed that you can reveal private SSL keys (how a second bug in OpenSSL made this possible) the incredible impact of revoking over 100,000 certificates in a single day, and the results of our honeypot revealing the proportion of attack traffic versus research traffic. ", 
                                "description": "CloudFlare was notified about Heartbleed as soon as it was discovered--ahead its public announcement--and took extreme precaution to not reveal anything about the bug. This required communicating only over secure channels, restricting the visibility of the branch from which we built the workaround, and using secure software deployment methods.\r\n\r\nAfter the patch was announced, there was a rush to reverse engineer the bug and create an exploit. The cloudFlare team immediately started working proof of concept, and hosted it on a website allowing others to scan for vulnerable sites. Within minutes, the original site was flooded with requests. CloudFlare\u2019s Nick Sullivan will share this process and the feats pulled off to make sure the site could scale and provide accurate results. He will go into the numbers and technical details of the PoC and speak about its bugs and how they were found. Statistics and anonymized raw data of the 70+ millions of results will be provided, giving an overview of the patching process over time.\r\n\r\nIt was clear soon after the bug was revealed that the number of servers affected by this bug was massive. What wasn\u2019t clear was the scope of data that was vulnerable to attack. In order to determine the risk to private keys from this vulnerability, his team launched the CloudFlare Heartbleed Challenge. They set up a site that was vulnerable to the attack, added logging and created a webpage to submit a signed proof of key ownership. In less than a day, there were several successful submissions. Nick will go over the naive (but successful) strategy used to extract keys and the more advanced technique based on Coppersmith\u2019s Method. Finally he  will discuss the *second* OpenSSL bug we discovered that allowed the private key to be extracted via Heartbleed.\r\n\r\nAfter the exploits were in the wild, his team added logging to see who was trying to exploit this bug. Nick will reveal the results of this analysis and cross-reference the results with the IPs of the test site. These numbers give new insight into how many people were attempting to maliciously exploit this flaw versus research done to probe vulnerable sites.\r\n\r\nOnce the dust settled and the team worked out the details with our CA, we revoked over 80,000 of CloudFlare\u2019s SSL certificates. This turned into an internet scaling nightmare, resulting in a constant flood of more than 40 gigabits per second of traffic to serve overgrown certificate revocation lists. Since CloudFlare provides caching for its CA, the team bore the brunt of this traffic. Their revocation lists would have DDoSed most sites (and some certificate authorities) off the internet. Nick will talk about caching CRLs, and how the revocation system was not designed for this scale of internet flaw.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we he will summarize the many ways this coding error revealed some of the deeper flaws in the internet, and discuss ways we can move forward. Nick will share actionable advice and the security strategies used by cloud service companies on how to monitor the way companies store keys internally.\r\n\r\nAttendees will leave with actionable advice on how to better secure their own systems against the next Heartbleed and the security strategies used by cloud service companies on how to monitor the way companies store keys internally.",

As we will see, even our ideas of the physical universe turn out to be computational. Let us explore some fascinating scenery of the philosophy underlying Artificial Intelligence.", 
                                "description": "How do minds work? In my view, this is the most interesting question of all, and our best bet at answering it lies in building theories that we can actually test in the form of computer programs, that is, in building Artificial Intelligence. Let us explore some of the philosophical ideas that explicitly or implicitly form the basis of Artificial Intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe idea that minds are some kind of machine, mechanical contraptions, seems to be unconvincing, even offending to many people, even if they accept that the physical universe is a machine, and minds are part of that universe. Computer science has revolutionized our concept of machines, though: no longer do we see machines as mechanical arrangements of parts that pull and push against each other, but as arbitrary, stable causal arrangements that perform regular changes on their environment. We can think about mathematical machines, like cellular automatons, about financial, social or ecological machines. Machines do not have to be human-made artifacts, they are a way of conceptualizing regular processes and dynamic systems. In the case of conceptualizing the human mind, what matters is not biology, chemistry, or structural properties of the brain, but what these implement: a class of machine that is capable to process information, in very specific ways. The mind is not necessarily a mechanical machine, but certainly an information processing machine, a computational system. \r\n\r\nComputationalism is the notion that minds can and have to be modeled as computational, and in its strong form, it maintains that the mind actually _is_ a computer, implemented by a physical mechanism. But the ideas of computation have permeated our understanding of the world even further. Our understanding of physics no longer conforms to mechanical world views (i.e. parts and particles pulling and pushing against each other), but requires us to switch to the broader notion of how the universe processes information. The foundational theories of physics are concerned with how the universe is computed.\r\nIn the view of universal computationalism, the question of what sort of thing minds are resolves into the question whether hypercomputation is possible, and if not, what classes of computation are involved in their functionality.\r\n\r\nComputationalism systematizes the intuitions we get naturally while we program computers, and it helps us understand some of the deepest questions of cosmology, epistemology and the nature of the mind in ways that did not exist in the past.",

Due to this we ran into some issues but ultimately succeeded. We believe that the details of the techniques that we used will prove useful for anyone attempting similar actions in the future. The topics that we will discuss in this talk will cover a wide range of high and low level issues related to network protocol and binary reversing. \r\n\r\nWe will begin with an overall survey of the general problems faced by anyone attempting this type of work. The talk will quickly delve from the high-level and simple issues into the more technical aspects of reverse engineering in the blind. We will be including the techniques we used to determine the protocol and payload responses that the client was expecting. Describing in detail how we honed in on common traits that we expected to see on the network, using open source knowledge and binary level reverse engineering of client code to determine the expected response.\r\n\r\nWe expect the attendees of this talk to walk away with knowledge that will help them in the future when working on similar projects or any activities related to protocol reverse engineering.",

Aus\r\n  Sicherheitsgr\u00fcnden sollte f\u00fcr jede Transaktion eine neue Adresse\r\n  verwendet werden, was bisher nur aus Datenschutzgr\u00fcnden empfohlen\r\n  wurde.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Was sehen Sie an der bei Bitcoin verwendeten Kryptografie kritisch?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Auch wenn man sicher an einigen Stellen aus Sicht der\r\n  Kryptographieforschung die ein oder andere Verbesserung vorschlagen\r\n  k\u00f6nnte, welche auch teilweise schon in alternativen Systemen\r\n  erfolgreich eingesetzt werden, ist jedoch gerade die Einfachheit und\r\n  Robustheit der eingesetzten Konstruktionen zu loben. Die Autoren\r\n  verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber ausgezeichnete Kryptographiekenntnisse.\r\n\r\n  Die in bitcoin verwendete Kurve Secp256k1 wurde zwar begr\u00fcndet\r\n  ausgew\u00e4hlt, bedarf jedoch einer intensiveren Beforschung. Die 256 bit\r\n  Schl\u00fcssell\u00e4nge verschafft keinen beruhigenden Sicherheitsspielraum.\r\n  Eine Wahl von 512 bit w\u00e4re die bessere Wahl gewesen.  Auch w\u00fcrde eine\r\n  Wahl von unterschiedlichen Kurven f\u00fcr jede Transaktion st\u00e4rker der\r\n  Bitcoin-Philosophie entsprechen.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 K\u00f6nnen Sie grob einsch\u00e4tzen wie lange es noch dauert bis der erste\r\nechte funktionierende Quantencomputer entwickelt wird? Wie hoch ist\r\nIhrer Einsch\u00e4tzung nach die Chance, dass das in den kommenden\r\nJahrzehnten passiert?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Es ist leider von au\u00dfen sehr schwer einzusch\u00e4tzten wie weit die\r\n  amerikanischen Dienste bei der Entwicklung von Quantencomputern\r\n  gekommen ist. Die Enth\u00fcllung von Snowden zeigten, dass die US\r\n  Regierung erhebliche Mittel zur Erforschung von neuartigen\r\n  Angriffsm\u00f6glichkeiten aufwendet In jedem Falle erscheinen Public Key\r\n  Schl\u00fcssell\u00e4ngen von mehr als die \u00fcblichen 256 bit empfehlenswert.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Warum wird heute PostQuantum-Kryptographie so gut wie noch nicht\r\nverwendet? Was sind die H\u00fcrden beim Einsatz? W\u00e4re es m\u00f6glich Bitcoin auf\r\nPostQuantum-Kryptographie umzustellen, ohne dass dabei alle vorhanden\r\nCoins ihren Wert verlieren?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PostQuantum-Kryptographie ist eine recht junge Forschungsrichtung. Die\r\n  bisher vorgeschlagenen Verfahren k\u00f6nnen oftmals noch nicht\r\n  hinsichtlich Schl\u00fcssell\u00e4ngen und Ausf\u00fchrungsgeschwindigkeit mit den\r\n  bisherigen Ans\u00e4tzen konkurrieren.\r\n\r\n  Es erscheint wegen der umfassenden Gef\u00e4hrdung der gesamten\r\n  Internetkommunikation, die bei einem Quantencomputerdurchbruch sehr\r\n  schnell eintreten w\u00fcrde, unabdingbar mathematische Grundlagenforschung\r\n  zur Entwicklung zukunftsicheren Verfahren st\u00e4rker zu f\u00f6rdern.\r\n\r\n  Bitcoin k\u00f6nnte auf PostQuantum-Kryptographie umgestellt werden, ohne\r\n  dass dabei alle vorhanden Coins ihren Wert verlieren.",

But right now its primary business function is to gather data about us, to categorise and sort us, to machine learn our most intimate secrets, all so that marketers can craft advertisements designed to extract as much money out of us as possible.</p>\r\n<p>As well as being the cause of our current privacy and surveillance woes, this business model is also a surprisingly inefficient way of matching consumers with stuff they actually want and need. A vast infrastructure of ad servers, data brokers, CRMs, and real-time bidding platforms exists in order to quietly nudge consumers to buy a different brand of soap. The problem is that we are easily nudged, and being a rational consumer in the modern economy requires an impossible amount of time, information and intelligence. Realistically, it is beyond the powers of human computation.\r\n<p>The seeds of a technology-driven alternative are emerging in some corners of the economy. A range of new tools crunch through masses of pricing and product data to help consumers avoid getting ripped off, and find the products they really need. Collective buying schemes have enabled households to club together in their thousands to negotiate better, cheaper, more sustainable suppliers of home energy and other products. The growth of free software, peer production and decentralised crypto-driven systems demonstrate that technology for independence, co-operation and empowerment are possible outside of the traditional market model. Combining these trends suggests a possible future where ordinary people collectively pool their data, computation and buying power to drive the production and allocation of goods and services, rendering the surveillance-advertising business model redundant in the process.</p>",

The Tarnac Ten are ten alleged anarchist saboteurs arrested in the village of Tarnac, France in November 2008 in relation to direct action whose court case. continues today. ", 
                                "description": "Ten people were arrested starting on November 11, 2008, charged with \"criminal association for the purposes of terrorist activity\".  The French government accuses them of associating with a \"terrorist enterprise\", causing delays to the French rail network by disabling over 160 trains.   One of the primary pieces of evidence was that one of the ten, Julien Coupat has also been accused of writing The Coming Insurrection, a popular anti-capitalist text. Although the case is still ongoing, the Invisible Committee has re-emerged with a new text called \"A nos amis,\" dedicated to  - amongst others - Jeremy Hammond. The book tackles the question of cybernetics as a mode of governance, from open data to Google to the role of hackers. From their new book:\r\n\r\n\"Behind the futuristic promise of a world of totally connected beings and machines, in which our cars, refrigerators, clocks, vacuum cleaners, and dildos will all be directly linked together by internet, is the evidence of that which is already here; the fact that the most powerful capturing device is already up and running: myself. \u201cI\u201d share my geolocalization, my moods, my opinions, my most incredible experiences of the day, or my most incredible banalities.  I post photo after photo of my vacations, my parties, my riots, my colleagues, what I am going to have for dinner and who I am going to fuck.  It appears like I am not doing anything and yet, nevertheless, I am continually generating data....nevertheless, in the long run, the abstract relationship between Western Man and the world, objectified across a vast ensemble of apparatuses and a whole universe of virtual reproductions, paradoxically reopens the pathway that leads to presence.  For just as we find ourselves detached from everything, we come to be detached from our own detachment...It is its very poverty, finally, that spells the doom of cybernetics. \r\n\r\n Liberty and surveillance, freedom and the panopticon are born of the same governmental paradigm. The infinite extension of surveillance techniques is the historical corollary of a form of power that manifests itself across the freedom of individuals. Liberal government is not that which exercises itself directly onto the bodies of its subjects or expects a slavish obedience of these latter.  It is a withdrawn power, one that prefers organizing space and reigning over our interests than governing over our bodies directly.  It is a power that waits, supervises, and acts minimally, intervening only there where the framework is menaced, when someone has gone too far... \r\n\r\nFor the individual, there is no liberty but supervised liberty. In other words, if the individual liberty of \u201cI do what I want\u201d is a farce, it is also a rip-off.  If the hackers really want to combat the government, they need to renounce this fetish.  The cause of individual liberty is what simultaneously prevents them from organizing themselves in stronger groups capable of deploying not only a series of attacks, but a veritable strategy; it is also what produces their lack of aptitude for linking themselves to anything outside themselves, their incapacity to become a historical force.\"\r\n\r\nWe would like to discuss the court case and what it means in terms of surveillance, undercover police, and the larger strategy of anti-terrorism as a mode of governance, a mode that now is a cybernetic mode of governance. Just as pressing though is the question not of solidarity with repression but seizing the insurrectionary moment: What can be done to make the hackers a historical force, one capable not only of creating a new form of cybernetic governance, but of ending governance itself?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Then in 2013 Corey Kallenberg presented the second instance of this class of vulnerability with an exploit targeting Dell BIOS. Now, in 2014, Rafal and Corey have joined forces to complete the destruction of the jedi^H^H BIOS. \r\n\r\nThe UEFI firmware is normally the first code to execute on the CPU, putting it in a powerful position to subvert other components of the platform. Because of its security critical nature, the UEFI code resides on a flash chip that is protected against arbitrary writes via a number of chipset protection mechanisms. Besides initializing the platform and bootstrapping to an operating system, UEFI is also charged with instantiating the all powerful System Management Mode (SMM). SMM is neither readable or writeable by any other code on the platform. In fact, SMM has the ability to read and write hypervisor protected memory, but the converse is not true! These properties make SMM an ideal place to store a rootkit. Similar to the UEFI firmware, because of these security critical properties, there are hardware mechanisms that protect the integrity and confidentiality of SMM. \r\n\r\nThis talk will explore attack surface against SMM and UEFI that has not previously been discussed. We will highlight a bug in one of the critical hardware protection mechanisms that results in a compromise of the firmware. We will also directly target a part of the UEFI specification that provides SMM exploitation opportunities. The vulnerabilities disclosed and their corresponding exploits are both prevalent among UEFI systems and reliably exploitable. \r\n\r\nThe consequences of these vulnerabilities include hypervisor and TXT subversion, bricking of the victim platform, insertion of powerful rootkits, secure boot break, among other possibilities. \r\n",

                                "description": "Speakers: Sarah Harrison: Courage Acting Director and WikiLeaks Investigations Editor and Grace North: Jeremy Hammond campaign manager \r\n\r\nWith current technology the ability for journalists to be provided with large data sets securely is increasing. With the surveillance revelations from Snowden there is much talk about ways for the public and journalists to work online safely, and how this can be used to help protect sources. However, there are few to no discussions about a holistic attitude to source protection. In fact we can see in the past that its often not technical, but operational security issues that pose the greatest threat to source's ongoing safety, whether that is the source's or journalist's operational security, informants, or lack of after care. \r\n\r\nSource protection begins at the point of contact, and it doesn\u2019t stop at publication - in some cases, the real work actually begins at publication. From the angle of investigations editor at WikiLeaks, a publishing organisation with a clean record of source protection, Harrison is well placed to explain the nuanced areas of source protection for media, from submission through to publication.\r\n\r\nBut its not just within the publication process that source protection needs to be considered. Simply not printing a sources name is not enough. It\u2019s irresponsible for journalists to speculate about sources they know little about, or to publicly speculate that an unnamed source is on the loose. Recently media outlets have suggested there is another NSA source, leaking information to the Intercept and elsewhere. What has that incurred? The US government launched an internal investigation to hunt out any other suspected sources, and we know well what the United States does to whistleblowers.\r\n\r\nAnd for media and the public alike there is an aftercare responsibility to sources that have risked so much for our right to know - how they are supported and spoken about. Both Harrison and North are experts in how media and the public have and should protect sources. Media generally abandons sources (they did in the case of Manning and Hammond in a devastating way), this can and should change. In addition public solidarity is vital for sources, we have this past year seen a growing trend in pitting sources against one another in the public domain: Harrison and North will discuss the dangers and consequences of this. \r\n\r\nWhile the use of the term \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is increasingly used and understood, it doesn\u2019t always describe a source. Courage uses the term \u2018truthteller\u2019 to encompass all people who bring secret truths to public light. Someone like Jeremy Hammond, who did not work for Stratfor or its clients, but knew its operations were of interest to the public at large, to the citizens of a government that subscribes to Stratfor\u2019s services, is a truthteller. He is an outsider who worked, allegedly, to make important truths public, and thus a vital journalistic source, without whom we wouldn\u2019t have hundreds upon hundreds of valuable news stories on the private intelligence industry. \r\n\r\nThese lessons give us a better understanding of what has gone right and wrong with recent high-level sources, like Manning, Snowden and Hammond, but they should also be building blocks for an understanding of the principles involved and how we can employ them in the future. Courage wants to continue protecting the sources we know about, but we also work to engender a culture of support for whistleblowing, a knowledgeable and ethical media class, and a trust among sources that journalists will protect them from start to finish. We encourage whistleblowing as a key method to keeping governments and powerful corporations accountable to the public, but we must be responsible first. This talk will explain and highlight these lessons from a first hand perspective, giving an understanding of what real source protection means, and how the media and public can perform it. The speakers will take questions after. \r\n",

Such usability problems of end-to-end email encryption tools have been around for a long time. In 1999, a seminal study found that most participants were unable to use PGP 5.0 to encrypt an email when given 1.5 hours to do so [3]. Others have tried to solve these usability problems by automating the key exchange and encryption [4]. However, issues persist around a lack of end-user trust in the software [5], difficulties in getting encryption widely implemented, and having to deal with a general absence of understanding the email architecture [6].\r\n\r\nDespite being almost 50 years old [7], email is still not widely encrypted on an end-to-end basis. In this year's SOUPS keynote (the major conference on usable security), Christopher Soghoian described how we as a community are not doing nearly enough to get security into the hands of consumers: we are mostly stuck with the same broken interface as PGP 5.0 from back in 1999, people still face the same conceptual barriers, and we still have crappy defaults [8]. While there has been renewed interest in end-to-end email encryption after the Snowden revelations [9], many projects do not take usability into account.\r\n\r\nThis talk goes into some of the dos and don'ts gleaned from the usable security research field. Building on a discussion of the history, methodology, and findings of the research, the talk will cover topics including the constraints of humans, the need for clear mental models, and the usefulness of user testing. Some examples of successes and failures will be used to illustrate a range of usable security principles. Remaining pain points such as metadata protection, key management, and end-user understanding will be covered, including proposals for fixing these such as anonymous routing, more appropriate metaphors, and trust on first use. Various open questions will also be discussed, including:\r\n\r\n- Should we patch the existing email architecture or should we move towards new protocols?\r\n- How can the crypto community build subversion-resistant collaboration platforms?\r\n- Is there a way to standardise our cryptoplumbing to a restricted set of secure algorithms?\r\n- Can we provide developers with usable coding technologies to prevent nightmares like OpenSSL?\r\n- How should we involve end-users into the development cycle of open source software?\r\n- Can we empower end-users to take security back into their own hands?",

Und trotzdem haben sich GIFs als Kulturtechnik durchgesetzt. Oder war es nur ein letzter Hype vor dem Tod? Wie kommt es, dass ein Medium, das schon in den 90ern veraltet war, sich noch zwei Jahrzehnte sp\u00e4ter bester Beliebtheit erfreut? Und was k\u00f6nnen wir daraus \u00fcber die Diskrepanz zwischen aktueller technischer Entwicklung einerseits und der tats\u00e4chlichen Nutzung von Technologie andererseits lernen?",

Mittlerweile ist es technisch v\u00f6llig \u00fcberholt, wurde mehrfach totgesagt, teils aktiv bek\u00e4mpft und wurde trotzdem nicht v\u00f6llig von der technisch besseren Konkurrenz abgel\u00f6st. Zu verdanken ist diese Entwicklung neben einigen Zuf\u00e4llen vor allem den Internetnutzern selbst. Denn obwohl sich GIFs technisch seit 1998 nicht mehr ver\u00e4ndert haben, findet das Internet immer wieder neue Anwendungen f\u00fcr die Zappelbilder.\r\n\r\nDer Vortrag blickt kurz auf die vielen Tode zur\u00fcck, welche das GIF-Format schon gestorben ist \u2013 oder die ihm gew\u00fcnscht wurden \u2013 und behandelt die aktuelle Entwicklung, bei der WebM angetreten ist, das Kapitel GIF zu beenden.\r\n\r\nViel wichtiger ist jedoch der Blick auf die Seite der Nutzer. Anhand von Beispielen aus den letzten Jahrzehnten werden Gr\u00fcnde daf\u00fcr analysiert, weshalb GIFs immer wieder belebt werden konnten.\r\nAm Ende bleibt die Frage, ob und wie sich das Erfolgsrezept GIF auf andere Medien und Technologien \u00fcbertragen l\u00e4sst.\r\n\r\nUnd: Ja, nat\u00fcrlich spielt auch Pr0n eine Rolle.",

We describe a heuristic algorithm which can detect vulnerabilities of this kind. We explain the inner workings of the algorithm and demonstrate a proof-of-concept attack on sevreral examples of vulnerable data, including files encrypted by the DirCrypt malware and encrypted traffic generated by malware such as variants of Zeus and Ramnit.", 
                                "description": "When operating a stream cipher, reusing a keystream introduces a critical weakness to the resulting ciphertext: the encryption becomes vulnerable to easy (and sometimes /very/ easy) cryptographic attacks. This is due to the encryption's linear nature - for instance, XORing a plaintext with the corresponding ciphertext yields keystream bytes. While key reuse is a widely known issue, it's an issue that keeps arising in practice. The soviets did it during WWII, Microsoft did it in the implementation of Word 2003 document encryption, and malware authors did it when designing variants of Zeus, DirCrypt and Ramnit.\r\n\r\nTo exploit a vulnerability, you must first realize it's there. Unfortunately, many instances of homebrew crypto operate on the \"security by obscurity\" principle, and don't reveal their implementation details. As a result, detecting key reuse often requires trial and error, an accidental epiphany or a night spent reverse engineering - and in all these cases, luck and human effort. In this presentation we show an approach to automating this task - based on the linear properties of stream ciphers, redundancy in the text and Bayesian reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithm's operation in several real-world use cases.\r\n\r\nMath Ph.D. not required.",

With the advent of Big Data, Cloud Computing, and the Internet of Things, much of our daily life is happening through digital channels. As most of us have learned, developers do not consider security to be an important point, imagine how much they consider the social aspect of their product or code. This is a huge problem, not only because it presents security and privacy risks for the users, but also presents moral dilemmas for hackers and researchers.\r\n\r\nSince my PirateBay blocking study, I have become interested in ethics in computer science. In that study I gathered personally identifiable information, to be able to prove that the website blockade was ineffective. These kinds of moral dilemmas are hard to judge, and in computer science we have no history of teaching or awareness about this.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Amsterdam, we have started an ethical committee for the System and Network Engineering Master.

The range of implementations starts of with dedicated Twitter streams, exploratory websites and ends of with APIs, consumable services and extensive statistics which allow analysis over time. You will get to know the detailed installation architecture which allows building your own toilet tracking.\r\nFurthermore, the talk outlines the serious aspects of the Internet of toilets and its importance for the society. Hygiene facts and economic considerations are discussed.\r\nOne of the motivations for this talk besides a general interest in the topic itself is the vision to realize such an installation for the congress in the near future (talking about 31c3).\r\n",

These are important debates, as net neutrality became one of the central questions about our freedom on the internet. With different faces around the globe we see a trend towards more violations of the neutrality principle which the internet was founded upon. The efforts of telecommunication companies to find new ways to monetize their networks and us users within them are countered in some countries with legislation preventing this new business models. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, after two years of preparation and a fierce battle, the Dutch\r\nparliament accepted a change to the Telecommunications Act which made net neutrality a principle that was protected by law. In this talk we will take stock after two years of legal protection of net neutrality in The Netherlands. Did it work and do the Dutch now have undiscriminated access to all services on the internet? Has the doomsday scenario of the providers, that subscriptions would become outrageously expensive, become reality? In which cases was the Dutch law enforced? \r\n\r\nAre there any loopholes in the Dutch implementation? If others are to\r\nfight for net neutrality, what are the pitfalls to avoid? And, on a more\r\nmeta-level, is it enough? Will net neutrality protect your freedom to\r\naccess websites and services, or do we need a broader type neutrality?",

Zahlen werden in Dokumenten durch andere ersetzt. Die ausgedachten neuen Zahlen sind dabei perfekt ins Originalbild hineinlayoutet.\r\n\r\nDie Problematik hat nichts mit OCR zu tun, die Zahlenersetzung passiert hart in den Pixeldaten. So ein perfekt getarntes Kompressionsartefakt kann ein Benutzer nicht sehen. Das ist lebensgef\u00e4hrlich, wenn man eine Autobahnbr\u00fccke oder eine Medikamentendosierung scannt oder die Lithiumakkus der Boing 787 vielleicht doch f\u00fcr die 767 gedacht waren. \r\n\r\n<b>Spa\u00df mit Xerox.</b> Nachdem David auf den Bug gesto\u00dfen war und Xerox nicht helfen konnte, ver\u00f6ffentlichte er ihn in seinem Blog. Die Geschichte ging durch die Weltpresse, was zu einem unterhaltsamen \u00f6ffentlichen Schlagabtausch zwischen Xerox und ihm f\u00fchrte. Xerox leistete zun\u00e4chst Widerstand, musste dann aber eingestehen, dass seit acht Jahren ein \u00fcbergreifender Bug in hunderttausenden Kopierern existiert.\r\n\r\nIn der Folge wurde ein Patch geliefert. Die Folgen von acht Jahren an subtil falschen Dokumentenproduktionen in zigtausenden Unternehmen, Forschungs- und Regierungsinstitutionen weltweit sind bis heute unabsehbar. \"Xerox Can Fix Number-Switching Scanners, but Not Altered Docs\", titelte das Wirtschaftsmagazin \"Businessweek\" treffend.\r\n\r\n<b>F\u00fcr die Aktivisten.</b> David skizziert genau, wie es von innen aussieht, den Widerstand von einem Gro\u00dfkonzern zu \u00fcberwinden. Er erz\u00e4hlt, wo er dabei auf die Fresse geflogen ist, was er daraus gelernt hat und leitet ein paar allgemeine Vorgehensweisen f\u00fcr euch ab.\r\n\r\n<b>Euer Kommen ist wichtig, denn das Problem ist keineswegs Vergangenheit</b>: Aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach existieren immer noch hunderttausende nummernvertauschende Scankopierer.",

These packages include smart cards, tags as well as standard packages for microcontrollers and special enclosures.\r\n\r\nCreative methods for amateurs and inexpensive ways for \"domestic use\" are depicted, including the manufacture of specialized devices and the production of dedicated preparation chemicals. For comparison, professional methods are presented in parallel, giving insight into today's industrial processes of chip preparation for reverse engineering.\r\n\r\nThe authors look back to over 25 years of private security research and nearly 20 years of professional engagement. They held their first chipcard talks and workshops 1991-93 at the CCC congress in the Eidelst\u00e4dter B\u00fcrgerhaus.",

", 
                                "description": "'Echtes Denken ist eine Sache, die das Gehirn selbst\u00e4ndig per Autopilot erledigt.' \r\n\r\nDer Vortrag bringt Texte aus dem Buch 'Serenit\u00e4t \u2013 Anleitung zum Gl\u00fccklichsein' der Edition 'Operation Mindcrash' zum Klingen. Elektra tr\u00e4gt die Texte vor, w\u00e4hrend Andi B. auf dem Keyboard dazu improvisiert. Durch die Kombination von Text und Musik kann man entspannt zuh\u00f6ren und sich dabei in eine heitere, gelassene Stimmung versetzen lassen.\r\n\r\nSerenit\u00e4t \u2013 ein deutsches Wort, dass vermutlich aus der franz\u00f6sischen Sprache \u00fcbernommen wurde, ist heute vergessen. Es passt auch gar nicht so recht zur deutschen Mentalit\u00e4t. \u00dcberliefert ist, dass im 18. Jahrhundert im deutschen Sprachraum Personen h\u00f6chsten Respekts als 'Ihre Serenit\u00e4t' angesprochen wurden, im Sinne von 'Ihre Erhabenheit' oder 'Durchlaucht'. Im Franz\u00f6sischen und Englischen ist der Begriff dagegen gel\u00e4ufiger und bedeutet Heiterkeit, Gelassenheit, Erhabenheit, Klarheit, innere Ruhe, Frieden mit sich selbst.\r\n\r\nHinter dem Buch steckt eine radikale materialistische Philosophie \u00fcber das Gehirn und das Denken. Es geht um - oder besser gegen \u2013 die innere Narration der eigenen Heldengeschichte, durch die viele Menschen heute Ordnung in ihr inneres Erleben bringen wollen, indem sie sich selbst in ihrem Kopf eine Fabel, das M\u00e4rchen ihres Lebens erz\u00e4hlen.\r\n\r\nDer Vortrag geht an die Wurzel des Strukturmodells der menschlichen Psyche. Assoziationen mit dem Science-Fiction-Klassiker 'Snowcrash' von Neal Stephenson sind nicht ganz zuf\u00e4llig, aber nicht beabsichtigt. Wer Angst davor hat, dass sich in seinem Leben etwas \u00e4ndert, sollte diesem Programm besser nicht beiwohnen.\r\n\r\n Zu Wort kommen auch Franz Kafka, Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, Epikur, Julien Offray de La Mettrie, Jiddu Krishnamurti und Max Stirner. Vor allem letzterer hat es Elektra angetan. \u00dcber Stirner haben einige Philosophen gesagt, dass der Untergang des Menschengeschlechtes bevor st\u00fcnde, wenn sich seine Gedanken gegen die Entfremdung der Menschen verbreiten w\u00fcrden.\r\n\r\nUm Kopfschmerzen oder Schlimmeres zu vermeiden, sollte man nicht \u00fcber den Inhalt des Vortrags nachdenken. Echtes Denken ist eine Sache, die das Gehirn selbst\u00e4ndig per Autopilot erledigt. Machen Sie sich daher keine Sorgen! Nur echtes Denken hilft in Zeiten der Krise!\r\n",

As software gets more complex it gets increasingly hard to reason about it, this leads to a larger attack surface for bugs and security flaws.\r\nSome of these bugs can be completely eliminated with the introduction of type systems that keep our values at runtime in check. Type systems are in fact the most widespread mechanism to verify correctness properties of programs, with dependent types we take this to the next level.\r\n\r\nWhile most dependently typed systems (e.g. Coq and Agda) aim to be proof assistants rather than programming languages. Idris tries to answer the question how a general purpose programming language with dependent types could look like, it also enables us to produce self contained binaries as well as JavaScript applications today.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will introduce techniques for programming with dependent types as well as interaction with the programming language itself. Examples will present resource tracking in the type system e.g. tracking file handles and yielding compilation errors on resource leaks, modeling specifications of protocols as types and enforcing them.\r\n\r\nI argue that functional programming and dependently typed programming languages provide various exciting opportunities to the programmer, including a powerful mental model, compositionality and machine assisted programming through interactive editing capabilities. The presentation software for this talk will be a web application written in Idris which compiles to JavaScript using a compiler backend written by the lecturer.",

The idea of reusing a dvd burner laser was nice and budget saving, some weeks later the first prototype wrote \"hello world\" on a piece of wood. \r\nAfter spending another two month of improvements two friends joined and the idea of kickstarting a mini series production was born. \r\nFinally the Kickstarter campaign was the reason for a lot of travel: Erfurt, Berlin, Barcelona, Tiflis, Vienna, Rome, Austin, San Francisco. On the road were awesome highlights as well as deep depressions.\r\nAll in all we didn't get rich in the end, but we got lots of experience in many different areas. \r\nWe believe that crowdfunding is a huge opportunity to develop things that otherwise never would have been done. We are happy to share all the lessons learned on our way. Hopefully other projects cause less headache with this knowledge.\r\n",

Also, we have free cookies.\r\nThe findings we published earlier this year demystified the voodoo that is TR-069, demonstrated how mass pwnage can be achieved via server-side attacks, and proved the landscape is ripe for harvesting. We will continue where we left off to explore TR-069 client-side vulnerabilities; we analyze client implementations, pour some insight into mysterious results from our internet-wide scans, and follow to mass pwnage through remote code execution on millions of online devices. again.\r\n", 
                                "description": "TR-069 is the de-facto standard remote management protocol that ISPs surreptitiously use to control consumer-premises equipment (these would be your home routers, set-top boxes, VoIP phones etc.), rumored to be a well-thought conspiracy devised by Internet Service Provider secret societies since the 17th century.\r\n\r\nSince its establishment in 2004, there has been a growing trend of endorsement and deployment of the CWMP/TR-069 protocol in global carriers and service providers.\r\nDespite the rising popularity of this black magic, it is often overlooked in penetration tests and security assessments of Internet gateway device attack surfaces, and wrongly so. Would they reconsider if they knew TR-069 the second most popular service openly listening on the Internet (after HTTP)?\r\n \r\nThis talk will begin by describing our previous efforts presented this summer (DEF CON 22 & more), where our group revealed critically vulnerable TR-069 server deployments and discussed the incomprehensible asymmetry between the trust instated in this protocol and the measures taken to protect it (or lack thereof).\r\nSubsequently, we decided to go after clients \u2013 exposing a critical attack surface by design, listening on 0.0.0.0 with a publicly available IP address. While centralized servers are rather easily patched to close security holes, clients may take more effort\u2026\r\n \r\nWe will conclude with the shocking unveiling of one of the year's security stories, walking the audience through the discovery and exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in an extremely popular client implementation. Our weapon of choice this round would be embedded device reverse engineering (some soldering required), leading us all the way to remote code execution on millions of devices.",

It presents a 'free phonebox' project, which was tested at the FutureEverything art and technology festival in 2014, as an example of a social-technical system that promotes identity ambiguity in communication through the sharing of 'free' mobile phone minutes between strangers.", 
                                "description": "The project presented in this talk uses a computer running debian to connect a USB handset to one of a number of 'donor' mobile phones by acting as a bluetooth handsfree headset to each of the mobiles. The project is based on No Hands a GPLv2 implementation of the Bluetooth HFP 1.5 Hands Free Protocol. A free phonebox that randomly assigns calls made to one of the participating mobiles nearby acts a little like a low-tech remailer (mix network node). Lending strangers your phone creates 'data chaff' that helps to muddy the call record metadata logs that otherwise tie your device to you as a form of identification and tracking. It provides (some) deniability for any calls made while nearby the phonebox. Borrowing a stranger's phone lets you call someone without revealing yourself through caller-id. The close range of bluetooth, imposes a geographic limit on users.\r\n\r\nThis talk considers why a project like a free phonebox may be useful in countering growing moves to criminalise anonymous communication. People generally see the 'free time' in their mobile cell phone call plans as something that belongs to them. Lending someone in need your phone is also seen as charitable and positive. Therefore, a system that shares phone minutes between strangers provides an easier forum for debate around preservation of anonymity in communication than a similar project lending wifi connectivity. Open wifi has been gradually characterised as a tool for malicious hackers, unethical pirates and tech-savvy criminals despite the significant advantages universal connectivity could offer. Historical examples of anonymising connectivity including phoneboxes and postal systems are discussed.\r\n\r\nThe public phonebox in particular has long been associated with elements of privacy, secrecy and anonymity. The physical box affords a semi-private space in a public setting. Sound is difficult to overhear, but the caller is still in view of those nearby. Phoneboxes have historically used an anonymous payment system of coins, and require no identity authentication for access. In many countries policies of regulating call costs and mandating maintained phonebox coverage have established phoneboxes as anonymous connectivity commons. Many accounts of phoneboxes in popular culture portray them as valued resources of personal independence. Phoneboxes often provide the backdrop for narratives of family contact, emergency assistance or first kisses. The cheap and near universal nature of the phonebox makes them a recognisable anchor of reliability in new situations and locations. I would argue it is no coincidence that Superman turns to the phonebox for a moment of privacy when changing from one pseudonym to another.\r\n\r\nBen Dalton is an artist and academic researcher trained in physics, electronics and communication design, who has worked on projects on distributed sensor networks and ubiquitous computing at the MIT Media Lab, USA, big screens and pocket screens in public space at Leeds Beckett University, UK, the aesthetic, ethical and spatial dimensions of the politics of data at the National Academy of Art & Design in Bergen (KHiB), Norway, and digital pseudonymity at the Royal College of Art, UK.

Attendants will learn the basics of how to yarnbomb the 31C3 (or any other place indoor or outdoor). Bring knitting needles and wool but there will also be some material available (if you want to donate yarn, bring it along or bring it to the T-Shirt Shop). Lets join forces to beautify the congress centre! This time, I suggest we use the colour code of the 31C3 for yarnbombing (see long description for details on colours and measures).",

Typically, this is done by a central server keeping track of who is online and offline, as well as of the complete friend graph of users.  However, the Snowden revelations have shown that address book and buddy list information is routinely targetted for mass interception.  Hence, some social service providers, such as activist organizations, do not want to even possess this information about their users, lest it be taken or compelled from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Private information retrieval, or PIR, allows clients to download information from online databases without revealing to the database operators what information is being requested.

The bootkit can be easily installed by an evil-maid via the externally accessible Thunderbolt ports and can survive reinstallation of OSX as well as hard drive replacements.  Once installed, it can prevent software attempts to remove it and could spread virally across air-gaps by infecting additional Thunderbolt devices.", 
                                "description": "It is possible to use a Thunderbolt Option ROM to circumvent the cryptographic signature checks in Apple's EFI firmware update routines. This allows an attacker with physical access to the machine to write untrusted code to the SPI flash ROM on the motherboard and creates a new class of firmware bootkits for the MacBook systems.\r\n\r\nThere are neither hardware nor software cryptographic checks at boot time of firmware validity, so once the malicious code has been flashed to the ROM,  it controls the system from the very first instruction.   It could use SMM and other techniques to hide from attempts to detect it.\r\n\r\nOur proof of concept bootkit also replaces Apple's public RSA key in the ROM and prevents software attempts to replace it that are not signed by the attacker's private key.  Since the boot ROM is independent of the operating system, reinstallation of OS X will not remove it.  Nor does it depend on anything stored on the disk, so replacing the harddrive has no effect.  A hardware in-system-programming device is the only way to restore the stock firmware.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Thunderbolt devices' Option ROMs are writable from code that runs during the early boot and the bootkit could write copies of itself to new Thunderbolt devices.  The devices remain functional, which would allow a stealthy bootkit to spread across air-gap security perimeters through shared Thunderbolt devices.\r\n\r\nWhile the two year old Option ROM vulnerability that this attack uses can be closed with a few byte patch to the firmware, the larger issue of Apple's EFI firmware security and secure booting with no trusted hardware is more difficult to fix.",

UNHash as a tool uses rulefiles that are something in between of a DSL (Domain specific language) and a python script to describe the password cracking process. That way, we have the possibility to describe complex password cracking rules that contain dictionaries, rules, bruteforcing, joining, combining and other patterns in a language that is easily human readable and extensible. To stop reinventing the wheel, UNHash generates candidate passwords for john the ripper, hashcat or a lot of other tools that can read stdin.\r\n\r\nThe usage of \"slow\" hashes like bcrypt and scrypt will require us to try a smaller quantity of possible passwords, but with more detailed targeting. The concept behind UNHash is to enable such attacks against modern slow hashes or to enable better targeting and be faster and easier then traditional methods. \r\n\r\nTo make use of the new \"language\", we need set of rules. To generate rulesets, we will show a new machine learning algorithm that can analyze plaintext passwords and generate rules for UNHash. The machine learning algorithm shows a classifier network heuristic that we call the sieve algorithm that can classify passwords and show how users generate their passwords. Training the classifier on about 30+ million unique passwords, can yield interesting rules that describe how users pick their passwords.\r\n\r\nSince we are already classified passwords, why not use the effort to collect all password elements like words (and see which languages do they belong), strings, numbers and mutations so we can use that as a cornerstone for a new set of dictionaries. Since we already said said that we want to identify words and their languages, we needed to create a linguistic dictionary for word the use in the classifier algorithm. We will show how to create custom dictionaries for various languages or from a specific domain by parsing wikipedia database backups or by abusing really popular web services. \r\n\r\nA small portion of the talk will show why it is useful to scrape password dumps or obtain them via low interaction honeypots in order to collect known backdoor passwords. \r\n\r\nWe will skip the science and get to the practical part - How can you use UNHash for better password cracking and how to implement more classifiers so we can have a better models of how users create their passwords.\r\n",

Every year there are more visitors, more and often better talks on security issues, society, culture and technology in general. At the same time the social and political clouds that appeared on the horizon are now overhead and are even darker than expected. Discussing last year's big exploits and congratulating each other on our ingenuity in finding them is not enough. We have to wipe the smug grins from our faces and take a long hard look into the mirror. Because there are several questions that are often unasked because we may not have the answer to them. Not solving these puzzles also means that we cannot prevent the infocoalypse of big data, the internet of things, the military-industrial-surveillance complex as well as organised crime mucking up our lives. So let us talk about our failures to:\r\n\r\n- explain general purpose computing to laypersons;\r\n- preventing security weaknesses from happening;\r\n- articulate security risks to everyday people and politicians alike;\r\n- educate fellow tech people about them,\r\n\r\nAnd why they are failures and why there is an urgent need to fix them.",

And it's high time: There has never been a bigger discrepancy between the technical feasibility to share information and knowledge across all physical borders and the legal restrictions to actually do so. This talk outlines the unique opportunity and the challenge to bring copyright into the 21st century that lies in front of us. Hackers ensured that people were heard during last winter's public consultation. Can they now also ensure a progressive outcome of the reform process?", 
                                "description": "When copyright was last reformed on an EU level, YouTube and Facebook didn't exist, smartphones were unheard of. Last winter, the European Commission finally started a public consultation aimed at identifying all the ways in which the current copyright regime has been outdated by technological developments. Through projects such as Copywrongs.eu, which was developed at a workshop at 30c3, activists took it upon themselves to open the consultation to a wider audience and ensure that end users were heard. The tools they developed for that purpose, published under free licences, were even picked up by collecting societies to mobilise their members for replying to the consultation. The resulting over 9000 responses, half of which came from end users, reveal a deep divide: Individuals, cultural institutions such as libraries and scientists are calling for Europe-wide reform, whereas rightsholders are trying to defend the status quo. But the answers also point at some surprising similarities in the views of some respondents that can lead to new alliances and a copyright reform that truly finds a balance between competing societal goals.\r\n\r\nThe new EU commission was tasked by their president to present a proposal for copyright reform within 4 months of 31c3. After years of debate, 2001's copyright directive is finally being revisited. Promisingly, the mandate for copyright legislation in the new Commission has been moved from a directorate concerned mostly with economic issues to the one for \u201cDigital Society & Culture\u201d. The last Commissioner responsible for this field, Neelie Kroes, ended her mandate with a passionate call for copyright reform, describing the current legal framework in the EU as \"fragmented, inflexible, and often irrelevant\".\r\n\r\nBut what can we expect from the responsible Commissioner Guenter Oettinger, who's clearly not a digital native, and who has to answer to Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip, formerly a fervent supporter of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ACTA? I'll explain what the new structure of the Commission means for copyright reform, who the players are, the expected timeline, what we may hope to achieve and how you can help ensure an ambitious, progressive and user-friendly outcome. This talk is also a call for hackers to involve themselves in traditional arenas of policy-making and to become more political in their demands and activities.",

These protections include several ROP (Return-Oriented-Programming) checks, shellcode detection mechansims, heap-spray mitigations and many more.\r\nThe talk covers techniques to bypass EMET 5.1 (the current version) and shows the audience how hard/easy it is for an attacker to accomplish this.", 
                                "description": "The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is an application developed by Microsoft which adds an additional layer of security to applications to prevent attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in them.\r\n\r\nIt can be used to globally enable system mitigation techniques such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), Data Execution Prevention (DEP) or Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP). In addition special per-process protections can be added such as various Return-Oriented-Programming (ROP) protections (LoadLibrary, MemProt, Caller, SimExecFlow, StackPivot), Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF and EAF+) to prevent execution of shellcode, pre-allocations to defeat heap spraying and kernel exploitation, additional randomization (bottom-up randomization and mandatory ASLR) and advanced mitigations (deep hooks, anti detours and banned functions) to prevent different types of attacks.\r\n\r\nIf an application supports DEP together with full ASLR the difficulty to write a reliable exploit increases dramatically. The typical approach to defeat DEP is to use ROP to disable it. ROP builds on the idea to return (or jump) to small so-called gadgets (which are equal to already existing code from the code-section which end with a return or jump instruction) to chain these gadgets together to build new logic (like logic to disable DEP). If ASLR is supported by all modules of the application this approach can't be applied because the address of such gadgets is randomized by ASLR and thus unknown by the attacker. In such a case the vulnerability must be turned into an information disclosure vulnerability to first disclose an address to defeat ASLR. Techniques to accomplish this (e.g. partial overwrites, overwriting the length field of strings, ...) have already been discussed in the past and thus will not be focus of this talk.\r\n\r\nInstead further techniques will be discussed which can be used to bypass the additional per-process protections of EMET. To apply these techniques a vulnerability which allows code execution as well as leaking information (to bypass ASLR) is required. These requirements are satisfied per default because otherwise writing an exploit for a not-EMET protected application would be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is to demonstrate new and more reliable exploitation techniques as well as discussing in which situations already existing techniques can be applied in a reliable way.\r\n\r\nAn important approach of exploit developers is to write bypasses in a way that they can easily be ported to other exploits. For example, if a technique requires jumping to already existing code a dumb approach would be to build it application specific. Instead the technique can be built on top of the EMET library which gets injected into all protected applications and thus is a good target to minimize work load because the code for the bypass must only be written one time. To apply such techniques various methods to identify the presence, retrieving the imagebase as well as the version of EMET will be shown.\r\n\r\nEMET also supports none memory corruption related protection techniques (like Attack Surface Reduction ASR and certificate pinning), however these will not be discussed during the talk because the focus of the talk is on memory corruption exploitation (e.g. buffer overflows, use-after-free bugs, type confusion attacks and so on).\r\n\r\nAll techniques are implemented and demonstrated in a real-world Firefox exploit. Even if the vulnerability is older (we at SEC Consult don't want to publish reliable working exploit code for applications which are still in-use these days) it is a very interesting vulnerability to study and together with a highly configurable exploit it's easy to see the different techniques in action. The exploit works reliable against any Windows operating system (Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Server 2003, Server 2008, Server 2012, ...), on 32-bit as well as on 64-bit architectures and is able to bypass EMET in all versions (EMET 4.1, 5.0 and 5.1) with all protections enabled.  \r\n\r\nMicrosoft as well as other vendors typically suggest as a workaround for new memory corruption vulnerabilities to install EMET to protect the application. The aim of the presentation is to show the audience that attackers can still exploit such protected applications by using one of the many existing techniques.\r\n\r\nWe at SEC Consult do not believe in putting additional security layers like EMET, DEP, ASLR, application firewalls and so on on top of applications. Rather we demand from software developers and especially from the software industry itself to focus on secure software development instead of forcing their customers to create a chain of security layers to protect their software product.\r\n\r\nProtections such as EMET, DEP and ASLR are useful to add an additional hurdle for attackers but are not unbreakable.",

Roughly 15,000 nuclear warheads, each powerful enough to destroy a city, are in the hands of nine countries.\r\n\r\nThe most important international treaty on nuclear weapons states that only five countries can \u2018legally\u2019 have them.

How did that happen?\r\n\r\nMoreover, nuclear tests of different kinds are banned by a multitude of international treaties. An impressive global measurement network of hundreds of seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide measurement stations has been set up to detect nuclear tests. However, a treaty to finally ban all sorts of nuclear explosions, signed by 183 countries, is on the brink of failing. What is up with that?\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to provide a broad physical, technical and historical overview of the topic of nuclear weapons, and explain where international politics and verification technology stand today.",

Occasionally, they collide \u2026 because the Maker planet moves too fast.\r\nBut, back on the Earth. Encounters with patent law can be of many reasons, e.g. filing a patent application or being blocked in making by a patent (or much worse, being accused of a patent infringement). The latter motivated the question of the permissible uses of patented inventions. The talk explains which activities on patents are lawful and keep Makers safe in their making.\r\n", 
                                "description": "The Maker Movement does not need to be presented. Even the White House has expressed its gratitude and admiration for individual inventors \u2013 single heroes; and the World Bank has recognised their potential. \r\n\r\nBut the daily life of Makers is not (always) that sweet and victorious. As they get more technologically advanced, they face new challenges: financial, resource-related or legal.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the legal aspects, specifically on patent law. There are two ways Makers meet with patents: 1) they want to obtain a patent for their solution, 2) they get confronted with a patent infringement claim. The latter led to the question of the efficacy of patent flexibilities (\u201cpatent windows\u201d) that reduce the patent exclusivity over the use of an invention. They provide both the freedom to operate and enable defence in patent infringement lawsuits. \r\n\r\nThe project also contributes to the ongoing discussion on the reform of patent law, and suggests the re-consideration of certain legal tools in the light of the Maker phenomenon. \r\n\r\nBeyond any doubt, Makers deserve special attention in the legal field for a number of reasons:\r\n1)\ttheir technological contributions,\r\n2)\tpopularisation of democratic ideas: participation, trust and responsibility,\r\n3)\tfor making a part of this world better.\r\n(The patent system shared once the same principles \u2026 before it has changed into a money-making machine.)\r\n\r\nThe reference point for the research is collective making: when an idea leaves the safe private harbour (adverbial basements and garages) and enters open waters of knowledge dissemination and commercialisation, where a patent infringement may easily occur. Against this background I analyse the scope of patent windows (statutory provisions and doctrines) stipulated in four legal systems: Germany, the UK, the USA, and Japan. I present the main construction lines and apply them to the Maker environment. There are measures, e.g. private and non-commercial use or experimental use, that work in \u201cmaking\u201d but under certain reservations. \r\n\r\nThe talk serves advising and increasing the awareness of the scope of the permissible uses on patented solutions.\r\n",

In many countries, they play a critical part in airline security, but they have also been criticized for being unsafe, ineffective, and an invasion of privacy. To shed scientific lights on these questions, we conducted the first rigorous, independent security evaluation of such a system. We bought a government-surplus Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner on eBay and extensively tested it in our lab. We found that it's possible to conceal knives, guns, and explosives from detection by exploiting properties of the device's backscatter X-ray technology. We also investigated computer security threats: malicious software and hardware that can compromise the effectiveness, safety, and privacy of the machine. In this talk, we'll explain how full-body scanners work, describe the results of our experiments, and draw lessons to inform transportation security, embedded systems security, and the public debate over secretive and privacy invasive government technologies.", 
                                "description": "In response to evolving terrorist threats, including non-metallic explosive devices and weapons, the U.S. TSA has adopted full-body scanners as the primary passenger screening method at nearly 160 airports nationwide at a cost exceeding $1 billion.  Although full-body scanners play a critical role in transportation security, they have generated considerable controversy, including claims that the devices are unsafe, violate privacy and civil liberties, and are\r\nineffective.  Furthermore, these scanners are complex embedded systems that raise important computer security questions.\r\n\r\nDespite such concerns, neither the manufacturers nor the government have disclosed enough technical details to allow for rigorous independent evaluation, on the grounds that such information could benefit attackers, or is a trade secret. To help advance the public debate, we purchased a government-surplus Rapiscan Secure 1000 full-body scanner and performed a detailed security evaluation of its hardware and software.\r\n\r\nWe tested the Secure 1000's effectiveness by experimenting with different methods of concealing contraband. While the device performs well against naive attackers, fundamental limitations of its backscatter X-ray technology allow more clever attackers to defeat it.  We show that an adaptive adversary can confidently smuggle contraband past the scanner by carefully arranging it on his body, obscuring it with other materials, or properly shaping it.  Using these techniques, we are able to hide firearms, knives, plastic explosive simulants, and detonators in our tests.  These attacks suggest a failure on the part of the Secure 1000's designers and the TSA to think adversarially.\r\n\r\nWe also evaluated the security of the Secure 1000 as a cyberphysical system. We show how malware infecting the operator's console could selectively render contraband invisible to screeners. We also attempt (with limited success) to use software-based attacks to bypass the scanner's safety interlocks and deliver an elevated X-ray radiation dose. Lastly, we show how an external device carried by an attacker can capture naked images of the subject being scanned.\r\n\r\nOur results suggest that the Secure 1000 is not able to guarantee effectiveness or privacy against attackers who are knowledgeable about its inner workings, and that such knowledge is easy to obtain for an attacker with modest resources. We believe this study reinforces the message that security systems must be subjected to testing that is rigorous, adversarial, and public before they can be deemed safe for critical applications.\r\n\r\nWarning: Nudity. We plan to show unmodified scanner images in order to demonstrate the privacy implications of full-body scanning.\r\n",

CAESAR aims to identify a portfolio of authenticated encryption (AE) schemes with support for associated data (AD). Compared to ciphers like AES-CBC or Salsa20, protects not only confidentiality, but also authenticity and integrity of the processed data.  Before we give an introduction to CAESAR, we present the motivations behind the competition, like the importance to protect in-transit data, a lack of reliable AE(AD) standards or the repeated crypto failures in recent history that led, for example, to the cracking of WEP (aircrackng), and to attacks on (D)TLS, like BEAST and Lucky13.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second part, we talk about <strong>NORX</strong>, our CAESAR candidate: NORX is a user-oriented cipher, engineered to take advantage of modern CPUs and to scale to different levels of parallelism. NORX relies on trusted building blocks, adapted to meet our design goals:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>the sponge construction (as used in Keccak/SHA-3) is tuned to provide parallel processing</li>\r\n    <li>the core of NORX is inspired by the ciphers Salsa20 and ChaCha (by DJB), and the hash function BLAKE(2) (by Aumasson et al.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe explain how we selected NORX's operations and parameters to achieve maximized security and efficiency in both soft- and hardware. We also report on detailed benchmark results showing that NORX is among the fastest CAESAR candidates on various platforms, from ARM and x86 to ASICs. For example, on Intel's Haswell microarchitecture, NORX achieves 2.51 cycles per byte (more than 1 gigabyte per second), exploiting local parallelism provided by AVX2 instructions.</p>\r\n</div>",

                                "abstract": "Stylometry is the study of linguistic style found in text. Stylometry existed long before computers but now the field is dominated by artificial intelligence techniques.\r\n\r\nWriting style is a marker of identity that can be found in a document through linguistic information to perform authorship recognition. Authorship recognition is a threat to anonymity but knowing ways to identify authors provides methods for anonymizing authors as well. Even basic stylometry systems reach high accuracy in classifying authors correctly.  Stylometry can also be used in source code to identify the author of a program. In this talk, we investigate methods to de-anonymize source code authors of C++ and authors across different domains. Source code authorship attribution could provide proof of authorship in court, automate the process of finding a cyber criminal from the source code left in an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright, copyleft and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. Programmers can obfuscate their variable or function names, but not the structures they subconsciously prefer to use or their favorite increment operators. Following this intuition, we create a new feature set that reflects coding style from properties derived from abstract syntax trees. We reach 99% accuracy in attributing 36 authors each with ten files. We experiment with many different sized datasets leading to high true positive rates.  Such a unique representation of coding style has not been used as a machine learning feature to attribute authors and therefore this is a valuable contribution to the field. \r\n\r\nWe also examine the need for cross-domain stylometry, where the documents of known authorship and the documents in question are written in different contexts. Specifically, we look at blogs, Twitter feeds, and Reddit comments. While traditional methods in stylometry that work well within one domain fail to identify authors across domains, we are able to improve the accuracy of cross-domain stylometry to as high as 80%. Being able to identify authors across domains facilitates linking identities across the Internet making this a key privacy concern; users can take other measures to ensure their anonymity, but due to their unique writing style, they may not be as anonymous as they believe. ", 
                                "description": "Anonymity is a topic researched in detail at the Privacy, Security, and Automation Lab at Drexel University. We study how to effectively identify the author of text with unknown authors and how to anonymize text of known authorship. In our previous talks at CCC, we have presented methods to identify authors of regular text, translated text and users a.k.a cyber-criminals of online underground forums.  We introduced our authorship anonymization framework \u2018Anonymouth\u2019.  Many times, we received questions on how applying de-anonymization techniques would work on source code and different domains. In this year\u2019s talk, we will focus on identifying the authors of source code and cross-domain stylometry. \r\n\r\nCan the authors of source code be identified automatically through features of their programming style? Do they leave coding \u201cfootprints\u201d?  Holding important implications for protecting intellectual property as well as for identifying malware authors and tracking how malware spreads and evolves, this question spurred a cross-cutting research project involving NLP and machine learning.  Code stylometry requires features unique to coding and to the programming language.  Source code has different properties than common writing, such as the lineage, keywords, comments, the way functions and variables are created, and the grammar of the program. \r\n   \r\nAware that methods from text analytics can strengthen cyber analytics, this project sought to advance the potential of automated linguistic-type analysis, or stylometry, for authorship attribution of source code. A corpus of tens of thousands of users was built by scraping Google Code Jam Competition dataset.  Specifically investigated were new ways of representing coding style through NLP-inspired syntactic, lexical and layout features. Random forests with 300 hundred trees were used along with less than ten decision features per tree. The main dataset had 173 authors each with six source code files with less then 100 lines of C++ code.  A series of experiments was performed to discover the feature set that yielded the highest recognition accuracy: 91%.  57% of the features with information gain were syntactic and the rest were lexical and layout features. Tests on a validation dataset of exact same size showed 86% accuracy with the same features.  The features that had information gain in the validation experiments all had information gain in the original dataset, which shows that the method and feature set are robust and abstract syntax trees show best promise.\r\n\r\nSource code is just one domain studied in authorship attribution. We also study the problem of domain adaption in stylometry. Can we identify the author of an anonymous blog from a suspect group of Twitter accounts? The ability to do so would lead to the ability to link accounts and identities across the Internet.  We can achieve high accuracy at identifying authors of documents within the same domain, including blogs, Twitter feeds, and Reddit comments, even when classifying with up to 200 authors. Identifying the author of a group of tweets from among 200 tweeters yields an accuracy of 94% and identifying the author of a blog entry from among 200 bloggers yields an accuracy of 71%. When we try to identify to author of a collection of tweets based on a collection of blogs from 200 authors, however, accuracy drops to 7% using the same method and features. \r\n\r\nWe are able to increase the accuracy, however, by applying an augmented version of doppelganger finder, a stylometric approach for multiple account detection that can handle small stylistic changes. This provides significant improvements in each of the cross-domain cases.\r\n\r\nAdvances in authorship attribution offer both positive and negative repercussions for security. However, it is important to understand the assumptions that underlie these results. Blind application of stylometric methods could be dangerous if the domain is not understood. This work shows that stylometric methods are domain dependent. Whether used defensively or offensively, this is certain to impact user account security.  ",

J!NS MEME is the first consumer level device measuring eye movements using electrodes also called Electrooculography (EOG). The MEME glasses not a general computing platform. They can only stream sensor data to a computer (e.g. smart phone, laptop, desktop) using Bluetooth LE. Sensor data includes vertical and horizontal EOG channels and accelerometer + gyroscope data. The runtime of the device is 8 hours enabling long term recording and, more important, long term real-time streaming of eye and head movement. They are unobtrusive and look mostly like normal glasses.\r\nFor Google Glass I present an open sensor-logging platform (including the infrared sensor to count eye blinks) and a fast interface to do lifelogging. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss which eye movements correlate with\r\nbrain functions and how this fact can be used \r\nto estimate the cognitive task a user is performing,\r\nfrom fatigue detection, over reading segmentation\r\nto cognitive workload and the advances to track attention and concentration. Challenges discussed in the talk include how to get ground truth and how to evaluate performance in general.\r\n",

For example, what would it mean for the world if citizens from opposite sides of a war could swap bodies and feel what it is like to be part of the family of their own enemy? What if every school child could experience, in full immersion, the life of another young person half way around the world? How would this impact our ability to share our pain, address the challenges we share, resolve conflicts and build empathy, or even improve our emotional resilience as individuals?\r\n\r\nWe developed a system that allows users to enter the body of a different person and inhabit each other\u2019s experiences in a radically different way; a way of sharing that transports us to a place of preverbal, embodied empathy. The Machine to Be Another is a Creative Commons interactive system designed as a tool for embodied-immersive storytelling. We merge interaction protocols from neuroscience research in embodiment with performance, storytelling and virtual reality hardware to create in users the illusion of feeling themselves in the body of another person. Embodied simulation mechanisms, in particular of actions, emotions and corporeal sensations have been recently proposed as having deep implications in the understanding of empathy and social cognition, perception of one\u2019s body, neural plasticity but also in the formation of concepts .For example, studies conducted by EventLab in Barcelona suggest the effectiveness of inducing body ownership for reducing implicit racial bias. This \u201cbody swap illusion\u201d is so strong that a person can experience being in another\u2019s body when facing her own body and shaking hands with \u201cthemselves\u201d.\r\n\r\nFor two years we have been working with an extended community of researchers, artists, activists and members of the public to create performance-experiments related to the understanding of the other and the self. Through this processes we have explored issues such as mutual respect, immigration and physical disability bias, gender identity, conflict resolution, body extension and embodied dance performances. \r\n",

This part explains how the chaos game works and how to do an alternate, discrete render which works better in higher dimensions than 2D.\r\n\r\nThe third and final part takes a look at the Fractal Flames by Scott Draves, a different kind of iterated function system used in the Electric Sheep screen saver. The original algorithm for this is inherently 2D, but parts of it can be extended to higher dimensions, producing interesting results.\r\n\r\nDue to time constraints, it is assumed that the audience is already roughly familiar with - or willing to believe in - the general method for 3D projections, including vector and matrix maths. There will also be pretty pictures.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will have live demo segments mixed in, which make use of a F/OSS 4D+ primitive and fractal renderer called \"Topologic\" (see links, below).",

Now, 2 years later the industry giants have realised that connecting computers and kitchen devices can do awesome things. But do they create open standards? Of course not! They create little black boxes speaking strange languages that you can't integrate in an ecosystem that wasn't designed by the manufacturers themselves. We still want an open ecosystem for free exchange of information about food and recipes. We came closer to our goal. Let me tell you...",

Nope, because they only talk to one dedicated app. \r\nThere are cooking devices with touch screen, built-in recipes and sometimes even networking capabilities. But do we know how to talk to them? \r\nWe seem to be the only ones believing in the power of open standards. EveryCook is open source since the beginnings. Because we look at the large picture. We want to use ALL available data for cooking. Even data from WWF about sustainability or data from scientific research about nutrients.\r\nAnd we want to show how we treat this data. We want our database open for all useful input. \r\nAs we do for our Hardware. If you see a weak part in our designs you can tell us and we'll change it if needed.\r\nI will tell you what we learned making 4 generations of digital cooking devices. And I would like to explain you why we believe that there should be open standards for cooking software. \r\nWhat is now done \"in the market\" is that many companies develop many, many apps and some kitchen devices and none of them is made to interact with it's neighbors. Why? \"because my data is my data!\" and \"my hardware design is mine!\" \r\nIsn't that a huge waste of resources? Everyone re-inventing the wheel and then adding some little special sauce to claim the whole thing as \"unique\". \r\nHaving all data about food available is not a need, it is a human right. Having additional data on how to prepare food in machine readable form is a nice extra. Having both together in a database is the technically best solution because of the many synergies. \r\nLet's form the future of digital cooking before someone else does!",

When an attack transitions from control of a digital system to control of a physical process, physics and time become controlling factors instead of the digital rules encoded into your microcontroller.\r\n\r\nThe holly CIA trinity is meaningless in the physical world. The uncontrollable but still running process is not really available; process dynamics does not stop simply because the controlling equipment is DoSed; electronically segregated components can still communicate over physical media (the process) and a physical phenomenon can be measured terribly wrongly (so that the wrong measurement will be  proudly delivered to the digital application in a totally secure way). Where physics plays a governing role, IT security concepts are rendered useless. \r\n\r\nPlease welcome a new arrival in the \"damn\"-frameworks series - Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process. Come to the lecture and learn what it takes to exploit a physical process: how to find vulnerabilities and how to exploit them with minimal cost and maximum impact. Get astonished about the gazillion of uncertainties you will have to face on your way to disruptive goal and realize that the TIME is ONLY what matters while designing your attack .\r\n\r\nMake sure to visit local library and refresh your knowledge on physics, chemistry, mechanics, control theory, signal processing and algorithms. The lecture will teach you how to apply this knowledge in the exciting world of cyber-physical exploitation.\r\n", 
                                "description": "Attackers and researchers have shown numerous ways to compromise and control the digital systems involved in process control (plants, grids, cars). Little information is available what to actually do with those controls. A single bit flip can engage the burner under a tank of chemicals, but the reaction will still take hours to complete regardless of the state of the controller outputs. Changing the state of the outputs does not immediately put the process into a vulnerable state.  An attacker needs to take into account the timing and state of the system and act when the process is in the vulnerable state. \r\n\r\nDesigning an attack on a cyber-physical systems leads to unconventional  hacking and interesting computer science challenges. Thus, DoS attacks on controlls in the physical domain do not deny process dynamics. In fact, if timed wisely, DoS attack allow manipulation of the process at will. Whoever thinks that cryptography will safe the world is wrong. Due to the specifics of controll principles and their implementation in the equipment, DoS attacks allow manipulation of process controls even if the communication is authenticated. \r\n\r\nOn the example of the DoS attacks on controller inputs and outputs at the level of communication links the lecture will take the audience through all the stages and details of (i) designing and (ii) implementing such attacks to cause physical damage. The experiments are conducted on the realistic model of a  chemical plant used in process engineering research.",

It is not that easy to find pages that were made in 93-97 and are still online or look the same. Things changed in 2009, when Yahoo announced that they are closing Geocities, number one free hosting service of the last century, \"myspace of the 90es\", first home for many web users and a jest for \"professional web\"\r\n\r\nIn half a year yahoo gave its users to copy their data, Archive Team managed to partly rescue the pages and release one terabyte torrent of it. In 2010 my partner Dragan Espenschied and I started to download the files. In the middle of 2011 Dragan restored the archive and we started to go through the profiles: collecting, tagging, comparing, analyzing. One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age project started.\r\n\r\nWe don't only collect and restore but bring this culture of the 90es back to the web, using contemporary infrastructure. It is http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/ that posts a screenshot of a page every 20 minutes since February 2013. Or my channel on Vine, that allows to see those pages animated and with sound. And of course the blog http://contemporary-home-computing.org/1tb/ where we describe the findings.\r\n\r\nIn my HIGHLY ILLUSTRATED talk I'd like to introduce to the audience pearls of the early web culture, going much deeper than usual Under Construction signs and animated GIFs nostalgia. Will show what did it mean to make a web page technically, philosophically and ideologically. Will also talk about our unique technical setting for emulating the pages and what digital preservation really means.  And last but not least will talk about newer cases of deleted social networks and social services.",

What can a play from 1605 tell us about fairer distribution of natural resources today? Equally, how might a cyber thriller from 2011 help us debate contentious issues such as gene-based technologies and utopian visions of knowledge-led society? This talk considers agri-tech and food security across a wide sweep of social and political terrain, from the Arab Spring to the European horsemeat scandal, from Shakespeare to Daniel Suarez. It argues that the arts and sciences need to cooperate to deepen understanding about, and define actions on, the big challenges facing a needy world. Finally, it suggests ways in which the arts and technology can assist us in arriving at a model of society in which resources are distributed not only more efficiently, but also more equitably.", 
                                "description": "We are facing a crisis of food that threatens to overwhelm households, communities and even entire states. Inequality of access to sustenance has been exacerbated by soaring prices, corporate sharp practice and wide \u201cfood fraud\u201d \u2013 including 2013\u2019s UK horsemeat scandal, and Europol\u2019s expos\u00e9 of \u201cfake\u201d and \u201csubstandard\u201d food in Europe in 2013-14. Riots and political unrest that appear to have little connection with food, on closer inspection turn out to have dimensions associated with sustenance. For example, the first shop to be looted in 2011\u2019s London Uprising was not a branded trainers outlet or flat-screen TV centre, but the Clarence Convenience Store, raided for chocolate bars and bottled water. In its first moments, then, the unrest in Britain\u2019s capital took the form of a traditional \u201cfood riot\u201d. Similarly, the first wave of protest that gave rise to the Arab Spring was initiated by the self-immolation of a street vendor who made his living selling fruit and vegetables from a cart in Tunis. As a result of food-related political unrest, food security has risen on the agendas of governments and international agencies around the world.\r\n\r\nAgri-tech has come to be regarded as the panacea to food constraint. MEP Julie Girling is not alone in arguing that \u201ctechnological advancement will be the only way that we can meet the coming growth in demand\u201d. Certainly, the technization of food production and distribution \u2013 advances in gene-based technologies, synthetic biology, agri-robots, remote sensing, agri-infomatics and just-in-time (JIT) algorithms \u2013 offers a compelling vision of knowledge-led development. However, as this talk argues, technology is only one part of the story. Until the quality of public engagement is improved around agri-tech, the nature of our food, where it comes from, and the conditions in which it is produced, programmes aimed at establishing a more equitable, ethical, sustainable future society worth living will be compromised. In this regard, the arts can open a shared spae of imagination.\r\n\r\nThis talk develops findings from my forthcoming interdisciplinary book, co-authored with literary scholar Dr Jayne Archer and plant scientist Professor Howard Thomas, Food and the Literary Imagination. Our argument is that vital, deep knowledge about food, technology and society is to be found in art and literature, both historical and contemporary. In this talk, I explore what art and literature, as heuristic media, can tell us about our relation to food technology, what they can contribute to global debates about the ethics and mechanics of food production, and their role in helping us to imagine a society in which resources are distributed not only more efficiently, but also more equitably.\r\n\r\nPart 1 considers former systems consultant Daniel Suarez\u2019s 2011 novel Freedom TM (German title, Darknet), popular among hacker communities for its kinetic scenes of \u201cD-space\u201d cyber combat. At the novel\u2019s radical centre, however, is a vivid portrait of an utopian agricultural society founded on tech-led solutions to food supply. Suarez\u2019s \u201cdarknet farms\u201d of the future represent a serious intervention into the politics of C21 agri-tech and food security. In this respect, Freedom TM belongs to a long tradition of the arts exploring contemporary food politics, stretching back to include Shakespeare\u2019s play King Lear (c. 1605), key sections of which are set \u2013 modern directors often forget \u2013 in a wheatfield, and John Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain (1821), widely misunderstood as a themepark fantasy of rural life and the origins of food, regularly voted Britain\u2019s \u201cbest loved\u201d painting.\r\n\r\nPart 2 discusses three projects in which I am involved, each aimed at improving public dialogue around food and food politics at local and regional levels: (1) a creative commons project, \u201cEdible Wales\u201d (funded by CEWN/AHRC); (2) the Welsh Govt/EU-funded \u201cFood Engagement Wales\u201d; and (3) a project being developed with a major UK supermarket to examine practical ways in which literature can be used to promote public understanding of food as we search for a sustainable, resilient, more equitable future society.",

One image might be okay, but keeping track of the license and attribution of a thousand images in your mashup, or when quoting from massively crowdsourced data sets such as Wikipedia? Whoah! Don\u2019t we have computers to do that for us!? We do \u2013  but there\u2019s no widespread support for including licensing or author information when sharing or reusing digital works. This session will discuss how this should work in the open knowledge environment, and could it be that many problems regarding copyright and \"piracy\" in our digital society could be solved with the right technology?\r\n\r\nLet's take a step back and consider how we perceive photographs that we see, online and offline. Didn't you ever want to know who took that awesome photo that you scrolled past in a blog? Or find out more about where that image on Twitter or Facebook comes from? Finding this information for digital photographs can be a daunting task! Sometimes I don't even remember myself where a photograph I took was taken!\r\n\r\nMost people have a drawer of black and white photographs at home, a collection of the family history. A very natural reaction when you take a photo, which most people can also relate to, is to turn it over and look at the back of it, hoping that someone -- a parent or grandparent perhaps -- have written on the back of the photo when it was taken, where and who's pictured. The information scribbled on the back represent the context of a piece of art; it's what gives the photograph meaning and value. Metadata is the digital equivalent of your grandmothers handwriting -- giving meaning to pieces of art. By persistently associating the metadata of a photograph with the photograph itself -- making the metadata \"stick\" -- we can even make sure that your grandmothers handwriting stays with the photograph, even when someone photocopies just one side of it. Assuming the technology makes this easy, of course.\r\n\r\nVery recently, we've seen the emergence of technology enabling someone to copy a photograph from a web site, insert it into an editor, and have that editor automatically pick up the associated metadata and provide the correct attribution and licensing information. This has been made possible with the Creative Commons Rights Expression Language (CC-REL), other RDFa metadata, and a clever way of passing information between applications on the clipboard.\r\n\r\nIn order to relate effectively to the digital works we see online,  attribution (who made or built something) matters. It is obvious that proper attribution is the currency of the information age, and it's the start of being able to explore digital works online in their right context. This talk will focus on the philosophical background of why attribution matters, the benefits that technology can bring to the way we work with pieces of art (lolcats and Shakespeare alike), and where we're heading in the future.",

Even when they're hardware vs. virtualized/cloud, it's rare for admins to have direct physical control of the servers. Yet, most applications require a high degree of trust in the integrity of servers. We describe a variety of technologies and solutions to this problem, and a framework to best protect your applications and your users.\r\n\r\n<b>dename: decentralized, secure, usable PKI</b> by Andreas Erbsen:\r\nA major challenge for private online communication is public key distribution. Trusted authorities have failed to be secure, and the web of trust has failed to build the network effect it gravely requires to be usable. This talk proposes a new PKI system built on a cryptographic consensus protocol. A set of directory servers updates and signs a mapping from public keys to names. Anyone can run their own server, strengthening the security guarantee for all clients that know it. We have an open-source implementation that can be easily integrated with  systems that currently rely on manual key verification, including secure \r\nmessaging, host authentication, and software distribution.\r\n\r\n<b>New development in OTR</b> by Jurre van Bergen \r\nJurre van Bergen will speak about new developments in the world of `off-the-record` messaging. What is going on? Where are we going? In addition we will address frequently answered questions by developers and users.\r\n\r\n<b>Secure email communication - LEAP Encryption Access Project &\r\nPixelated Your Right to</b> by Varac\r\nThis presentation will introduce two new secure communication tools under development that help guarantee the right to digitally whisper \u2013 LEAP and Pixelated.\r\n\r\n<b>Dark Mail</b> by Ladar Levision\r\nSince Ladar Levison shuttered Lavabit during the summer of 2013, he has been working to solve the email privacy problems that made it technologically possible for an American court to demand unfettered access to the email messages for all of Lavabit\u2019s worldwide customers. After a year of hard work, the Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME) is a standards based, collaborative effort to create an elegant technical solution capable of protecting the privacy of everyone\u2019s email. It is focused on making end-to-end email encryption automatic, while providing message confidentiality, author verification, and minimizing the leakage of metadata. DIME capable systems reduce the amount of trust users must place in their service provider. Automating the key exchange process while keeping the system resistant to manipulation by sophisticated threats is an ongoing challenge. This talk offers a compressed discussion of the DIME standards, highlighting key portions and will be followed by a project update, where we hope to showcase a DIME capable client and server implementation.\r\n\r\n<b>TLS \u2665 DNS \u2665 Tor</b> by equinox\r\nReplacing 100 CA hierarchies with the single DNS hierarchy, and how the bite reflex against the latter is coming at the cost of less secure identities.\r\n",

From this, in this talk, we present a the information we found, from the list of the top onion addresses by content type and by popularity to estimates on size and turnover.  We will also present what the largest proportion of Tor Hidden Service traffic is (it isn't pretty, and it's not drugs/silk road!).\r\n\r\nFinally, I will explain the main classes of attacks useful for deanonymising the Hidden Services and Tor users.

By using cutting-edge cryptography  and committing to a high degree of openness in all parts of the execution, the project aimed to overcome public concerns about security risks and lack of verifiability.\r\n\r\nTo promote security, the entire voting system was implemented using a complex and verifiable cryptographic protocol, with no assumed trust between different system functions. To promote openness, the entire election system source code is publicly available, as well as most project documentation. The voting system would published the SHA-256 hashes of encrypted ballots on GitHub every hour, and detailed instructions were provided to voters on how to verify that their vote had been submitted.\r\n\r\nIn the run-up to the 2013 elections, the author audited the cryptographic Java implementation of the back-end election system, making a number of surprising findings. During the actual elections, a major encryption bug was discovered in the Javascript frontend code, potentially revealing the preferences of a large number of voters.\r\n\r\nMost hackers and cryptographers are highly sceptical of Internet voting, due to legitimate security concerns. Even so, insufficient technical security, or even the perception of such, does not appear to be a main reason for why the project was discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is twofold. First, we shall look at Norway's Internet voting project in its social and political context, highlighting the reasons why it came to be, and some of the key forces shaping the project throughout. Secondly, we discuss the findings, experiences and lessons learned from attempting to audit a large, public, complex and security-critical code base.",

                                "description": "Quantum computing uses quantum phenomena directly such as superposition and entanglement to perform data processing. However, applying these quantum concepts to macroscopic devices such as computers is an enormous challenge for information scientists and physicists alike. What does it make so hard? Well, scientists have to find a material in which they are able to store and manipulate quantum bits (qubits). Since quantum states are very fickle and thus hard to abide the most important task is to find materials in which qubits can be stored for a sufficient long time. Surprisingly they found these properties in diamond. More specific, scientists are investigating defect centers in diamond to be used as qubits. Although quantum computing in 2014 is still in its infancy first experiments have already been carried out that give hope that these computational concepts will become reality.\r\nThis talk is an entertaining \u201ctour de force\u201d starting with a brief introduction to the fascinating yet strange theories of quantum physics, the concepts of using these in quantum computing and the latest results on qubits in devices made out of diamond. Moreover this presentation is given by a physicist who was working on diamond for various other applications for years - who suddenly realized that he has the material for the next IT revolution right in his lab.\r\nIf you want to learn about the machines that decrypt your passwords in the coming years and how you can actually grow diamonds in your microwave oven (and who wouldn\u2019t?) this talk is for you!\r\n",

                                "description": "New methods and approaches for securing cloud environments are becoming increasingly more critical now that virtual environments are being widely adopted by the businesses sector. Despite the fact that virtualization itself is not inherently insecure, the majority of virtual systems are less secure than those physical systems they replace. This curious state arises primarily because traditional host security strategies are not well integrated into virtual environments: as an example, typical antivirus scans are a critical component of layered defense-in-depth, but they rapidly exhaust available CPU and memory when protecting a large number of virtual machines. Some antivirus vendors have taken a small step into virtualization by adapting their existing products to scan the disks of VMs from an external perspective, but this gain in efficiency does not fully realize the potential for protection and monitoring of a virtual environment. In addition, weakly implemented \u201dself-defense\u201d techniques leave themselves vulnerable to being neutralized by undetected or zero-day attacks. This \u201done opportunity\u201d for success is a critical handicap for existing protective measures.\r\n\r\nVirtualization nevertheless also offers a unique opportunity: the ability to peer into a running operating system from an outside perspective, known as introspection (VMI). It is possible to observe the memory, storage, CPUs, processes, and kernel of a running virtual machine from a safe vantage point. More interestingly, it is also possible to alter the behavior of all of these components to help protect virtual systems. The open-source LibVMI library has been designed specifically for this purpose, to look at 32-bit or 64-bit virtual machines, both on x86 and ARM. Over the last year, as part of DARPA's Cyber Fast Track program, LibVMI has been significantly extended by our team to ease the process of developing secure intrusion detection and intrusion prevention systems for the cloud. Utilizing Xen's advanced memory access system and the latest virtualization extensions available on Intel processors, LibVMI now offers unique capabilities for instrumenting, inspecting and controlling the execution of hosted guest operating systems and applications. Further combined with Xen's Security Modules, cloud security applications can be now tailored to provide a multi-tiered security environment required for multi-tenant cloud deployments.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will explore the finer details how these features can be utilized for the detection of advanced rootkits techniques, while providing a stealthy, tamper resistant environment. Our talk will explore the disaggregation of Xen's trusted computed base (TCB) with the use of the FLASK policy engine, and the changes our team implemented and contributed to Xen and the Linux kernel, to make secure cross-domain introspection part of a coherent mandatory access control system. Diving deeper into the virtualization details of the x86 architecture we will discuss advanced instrumentation techniques via the Extended Page Tables and via software breakpoint injection, and how these features are now accessible via the LibVMI API.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss critical details of live memory introspection and highlight common pitfalls in developing secure applications without relying on untrusted and potentially compromised data-sources. We will explore how mapping in-memory Linux and Windows kernels is performed by LibVMI, and compare it to other forensics tools, such as Volatility and Rekall. Our talk will further explore how to use existing forensics tools on live virtual machine to analyze modern malwares. At last, we will briefly discuss open challenges in virtualization security and some of the new CPU features proposed by Intel.",
